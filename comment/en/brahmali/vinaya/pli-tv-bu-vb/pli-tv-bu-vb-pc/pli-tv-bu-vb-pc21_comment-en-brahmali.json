  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.16": "“Are you all here?” renders _samaggāttha_, literally, “Are you united?” Sp 2.149: _Samaggātthāti sabbā āgatatthāti attho_, “Are you united: the meaning is ‘Have you all come?’” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.18": "For the meaning of _niyyādetabbo_ in this context, see the usage in the origin story to the next rule, [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.9](). Sp 2.149: _Niyyādetabboti appetabbo_ … _Ovādaṁ aniyyādetvāti eso bhaginiyo ovādoti avatvā_, “_Niyyādetabbo_: should display it. … _Ovādaṁ aniyyādetvā_: not having said, ‘Sisters, this is the instruction.’” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.19": "Sp 2.149: _Osāretabboti pāḷi vattabbā_, “_Osāretabbo_: the Canonical text is to be spoken.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.20": "“Acts of respect” renders _sāmīcikammaṁ_. Sp 2.149: _sāmīcikammanti maggasampadānabījanapānīyāpucchanādikaṁ anucchavikavattaṁ_, “_Sāmīcikammaṁ_ means appropriate duties such as giving way, fanning, and offering drinking water, etc.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.22": "The Pali word behind the translation “monastery” is _āvāsa_. This refers to the area of the _simā_, the monastic zone, as established through a legal procedure. This area may be much larger than the space occupied by any actual buildings. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.30": "Heavy offense, _garudhamma_, here refers to the _saṅghādisesa_ offenses, the offenses entailing suspension. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.36": "“Correct” renders _vacanapatha_. For the meaning of this word, see BVS, pp.73–76. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.38": "It is not entirely clear what this refers to, but it must somehow relate to what we find in segment 3.1.17 above. According to that segment, the affirmative reply by the nuns should be followed by a question about whether they are keeping the eight important principles. It seems possible, then, that the offense of wrong conduct committed here is a result of not asking this follow up question. Many thanks for Tracy Lau to make this connection. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.40": "Sp 2.149: _Ovādaṁ aniyyādetvāti eso bhaginiyo ovādoti avatvā_ “_Ovādaṁ aniyyādetvā_: not having said: ‘Sisters, this is the instruction.’” This, however, seems contrived. A more natural meaning might be to see this statement in conjunction with the previous one, and the two together might then be paraphrased as follows: If the nuns say they are not all present, then one should not instruct in the eight rules to be respected, nor in any other teaching. In any case, once “Sisters, this is the instruction” has been said, it seems any teaching can be given; see [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.9](). ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.2.1": "The legal procedure in question is the one that gives approval to a monk to instruct the nuns.

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.3.4": "That _osāreti_ must mean “recite” can be seen from [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc4:2.3.5]() where there is no offense if _osārentaṁ opāteti_, “he prompts one who is _osārentaṁ_.” The difference between _uddesaṁ deti_ and _osāreti_ is not clear to me. "
