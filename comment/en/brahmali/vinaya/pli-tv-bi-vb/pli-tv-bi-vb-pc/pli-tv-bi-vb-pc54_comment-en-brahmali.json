  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54:1.20.1": "“Refuses an offer to eat more” renders _pavārita_. I normally translate both _nimantita_ and _pavārita_ as “invited”. Yet this becomes awkward on the rare occasions, such as here, when the two words occur together, and so in this instance I instead use the verb “offer” for _pavārita_. Moreover, in the present case, the contextual meaning of _pavārita_ (see below) is that the monk has expressed his satisfaction after being invited to take more, thus my rendering. See the discussion of this rule in the Appendix. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54:2.1.7": "_Pavārita_ is often translated as “invited”, but the word also means “satisfied”. In the present case, the contextual meaning is that the nun has expressed her satisfaction by refusing an offer to eat more, thus “refused an offer to eat more”. For further discussion, see _pavāraṇā_ in the Appendix of Technical Terms. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54:2.1.8": "As with [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:3.1.8]() and [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:2.1.10](), the punctuation of the Pali is wrong. An additional comma is required between _ṭhito_ and _abhiharati_. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54:2.2.1": "The non-offence clause below states that there is no offence if one has been invited but not refused an offer to eat more. I therefore take _nimantita_ here to be a shorthand for _nimantita_ plus _pavārita_. "
