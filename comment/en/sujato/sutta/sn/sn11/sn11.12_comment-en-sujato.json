  "sn11.12:1.3": "Magha is from the Vedic word _magha_ as “gift, bounty”, thus the next sentence extols his generosity. A god named Māgha appears in [sn2.3](), although not associated with generosity. A brahmin student Māgha (“descendant of Magha”) asks about generosity at [snp3.5:1.3](). Finally, the good king of [mn83]() is named Maghadeva, “god of bounty”. ",
  "sn11.12:2.1": "_Sakka_ (_śakra_) was originally an epithet of Indra, the “able one”. _Purandara_ (“Fortbreaker”) is another epithet (eg. Rig Veda 1.102.7). The Buddha reforms it to _Purindada_ (“Firstgiver”) at [sn11.12:2.1](). But Indra’s generosity is long renowned, eg. Rig Veda 1.10.6c: “He is the able one, and he will be able for us—Indra who distributes the goods” (_sa śakra uta naḥ śakad indro vasu dayamānaḥ_). ",
  "sn11.12:4.1": "Vāsava means “endowed with wealth” (_vasu_; see for example Rig Veda 1.9.9a _indraṁ vasupatiṁ_ “Indra, lord of wealth”). This passage, rather, plays on the word _āvasatha_ and calls him the “giver of a guesthouse”. Later Brahmanical texts enumerated eight Vasus, with Indra as their lord, who are reckoned among the Thirty-Three. "
