  "sn6.1:1.2": "The name Nerañjarā is of unclear meaning, but the commentary suggests “sweet waters” (_nela-jala_) or “blue waters” (_nīla-jala_). The Sanskrit is _nairañjanā_. ",
  "sn6.1:1.9": "“Not supernaturally inspired” (_anacchariyā_) rejects the Vedic “channeling” of scripture from the Divinity, while “not learned before in the past” (_pubbe assutapubbā_), echoing the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta ([sn56.11:5.1]()), rejects the oral tradition. ",
  "sn6.1:5.2": "In such constructions the _bho_ in _vata bho_ adds rhetorical emphasis. ",
  "sn6.1:8.2": "The fact that the term satthavaha is used in such a solemn context in a society that has so long been sedentary speaks to it being an old cultural relic of the Aryans. This, as well as the context in general, speaks against anana here being based on debtless, a crude financial metaphor. The Skt root ṛṇa was originally a more generally term for the duties, especially spiritual, that a brahmin should perform, such as sacrifice and worship. In other words, the term is similar to the familiar katakicco. See http://sanskritdictionary.com/%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%87a/44184/1 ",
  "sn6.1:9.2": "paralokavajjabhayadassāvine should be rendered in accord with AN 2.1 ",
  "sn6.1:10.2": "_Pamuñcantu saddhaṁ_ has long troubled translators, as the basic sense of _pamuñcantu_ is “release”. The problem is a long-standing one, for Sanskrit variants include _pramodantu_ (“celebrate”) or _praṇudantu kāṅkṣāḥ_ (“dispel doubts”). I think it is a poetic variant of _adhimuñcantu_, to “decide” or “commit” to faith; it is extremely common in Pali to use a synonymous verb to reinforce the sense of the noun. In [snp5.19](), _muttasaddho_, _pamuñcassu saddhaṁ_, and _adhimuttacittaṁ_ are all used in this sense. "
