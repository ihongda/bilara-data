  "sn1.6:3.1": "This verse is found in Isibhāsiyāiṁ 29.2, where it is attributed to the Jain Vardhamāna Mahāvīra. His explanation there takes the “five” as the senses, which for the “waking” sages are “asleep” (i.e. restrained), while the unawakened “sleep” in ignorance while their “awakened’ senses run riot. The Pali commentaries, on the other hand, take them as the five spiritual faculties on the side of awakening, in contrast with the five hindrances. "
