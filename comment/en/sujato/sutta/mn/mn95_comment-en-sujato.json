His name is obscure; spelled _caṅgī_ in Sanskrit, it is perhaps related to the _gatāgate caṅgimā_ of Mahā-subhāṣita-Saṁgraha 7235-1, where it refers to the sensual walk of a young woman; dictionaries record the sense “beautiful” for Kannada _caṁgi_ and Sanskrit _caṅgiman_. | “Royal park” is _rājadāya_ (cp. _migadāya_, “deer park”). | A _brahmadeyya_ is a gift of land by a king to a brahmin, which was an outstanding feature of Indian feudalism.

  "mn95:11.2": "This student’s education is like that of Assalāyana ([mn93:3.1]()), but his character could not be more different. His name has a variety of spellings in Pali and Sanskrit, but the correct form is _kāpaṭika_ from _kapaṭa_, “fraud”. Kauṭilya explains that fraudulent students (_chātraḥ kāpaṭikaḥ_) were spies installed by kings to test the loyalty of subjects (Arthaśāstra 1.10.11, 1.11.1–2), a task for which they were paid handsomely (5.3.22). The Buddha calls him Bhāradvāja; it is a convention in Pali that brahmins of that name are distinguished by epithets, often unflattering: Bhāradvāja the Farmer ([snp1.4:1.3]()), Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper ([snp1.7:1.4]()), Bhāradvāja the Alms-gatherer ([sn35.127:1.1]()), Bhāradvāja the Builder ([sn7.17:1.2]()), Bhāradvāja the Rude ([sn7.2:1.2]()), Bhāradvāja the Fiend ([sn7.3:1.2]()), Bhāradvāja the Bitter ([sn7.4:1.2]()), and so on. Thus Kāpaṭika would have been an epithet recognizing that he was the king’s spy, a practice to which Pasenadi openly admits ([sn3.11:7.1](), [ud6.2:8.1]()). This was the downside of building a religious institution on the king’s largess. Whether he was recognized as a spy at the time, or the epithet was applied later, is uncertain, but at some point it seems the meaning was forgotten and the epithet was taken to be his proper name.

The Buddha is not recognizing Kapatika’s scholarly acumen, but the fact that the brahmins have set it up for a debate with him. ",

  "mn95:13.5": "BB has: “a single teacher or a single teacher’s teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers”. But see DN 13, which clearly treats the last two clauses as separate. That this is so in the current case is confirmed by the three “-pli” s. ",
  "mn95:13.9": "The ten names in Pali include the seven authors of the so-called “family books” of the Rig Veda (Maṇḍalas 2–8). As founders of poetic lineages, we often find works by their descendants, which are not always confined to their dedicated family book. Poems by the other three authors are mostly outside the family books. Thus the sages listed here cover most of the Rig Veda, although the Vedic tradition records many other authors as well. | Atri Bhauma (Maṇḍala 5, rather than Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitra of 10.104); Vamra(ka) Vaikhānasa (10.99; see 9.66); Vāmadeva Gautama (Maṇḍala 4); Viśvāmitra Gāthina (Maṇḍala 3); Jamadagni Bhārgava was a descendant of Bhṛgu (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Aṅgirasa is identified with Agni as the founder of a lineage of poet-singers (Maṇḍala 8); Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya (Maṇḍala 6); Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (Maṇḍala 7); Kaśyapa Mārīca (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Bhṛgu was the bringer of fire from heaven whose adoptive descendant was Gr̥tsamada Bhārgava Śaunaka (Maṇḍala 2).
