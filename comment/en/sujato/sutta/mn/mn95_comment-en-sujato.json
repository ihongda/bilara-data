  "mn95:1.2": "Opāsāda does not appear anywhere else. We later hear of Caṅkī’s longhouse (_pāsāda_), a luxurious residence to the north of the town on the way to the Godswood. Perhaps, then, Opāsāda means “down (from the) palace”. ",
  "mn95:1.3": "A grove in which offerings were made to the gods. ",
  "mn95:2.1": "“Royal park” is _rājadāya_ (cp. _migadāya_, “deer park”). | A _brahmadeyya_ is a gift of land by a king to a brahmin, which was an outstanding feature of Indian feudalism. Similar grants are mentioned in the Dīgha Nikāya at [dn3:1.2.1](), [dn5:1.4](), [dn12:1.3](), and [dn23:1.4](). ",
  "mn95:4.1": "",
  "mn95:5.1": "Also a favored siesta location for Soṇadaṇḍa ([dn5:3.1]()), Kūṭadanta ([dn4:3.1]()), and Pāyāsi ([dn23:3.1]()). ",
  "mn95:5.3": "khatta in this sense only appears in this and parallel passages. BB has “minister”, but this is supported neither by Cone nor Skt. ",
  "mn95:8.9": "For MS _vacchasī_ read _vaccasī_ (Sanskrit _varcasin_), “possessing splendor”. ",

  "mn95:9.35": "BB has “each one of these factors”, which is incorrect. Ekamekenapi means “even a single one” see eg AN 11.16, AN 7.22, MN 85 ",
  "mn95:12.2": "I can’t see how BB’s “must be accomplished in the scriptures” is justified. Literally it reads: “Of Kapatika there will be talk about the scripture of the three vedas”. Sure, the future tense can, rarely, have the sense of “must be”, but there seems no call for it here. The Buddha is not recognizing Kapatika’s scholarly acumen, but the fact that the brahmins have set it up for a debate with him. ",
  "mn95:12.3": "purakkharoti, which I assume is equivalent to purekkharoti, is usually used in the suttas in a simple physical sense, placing at the front, with the idea of that being a position of honor as a secondary implication. ",
  "mn95:13.5": "BB has: “a single teacher or a single teacher’s teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers”. But see DN 13, which clearly treats the last two clauses as separate. That this is so in the current case is confirmed by the three “-pli” s. ",
  "mn95:13.9": "The ten names in Pali include the seven authors of the so-called “family books” of the Rig Veda (Maṇḍalas 2–8). As founders of poetic lineages, we often find works by their descendants, which are not always confined to their dedicated family book. Poems by the other three authors are mostly outside the family books. Thus the sages listed here cover most of the Rig Veda, although the Vedic tradition records many other authors as well. | Atri Bhauma (Maṇḍala 5, rather than Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitra of 10.104); Vamra(ka) Vaikhānasa (10.99; see 9.66); Vāmadeva Gautama (Maṇḍala 4); Viśvāmitra Gāthina (Maṇḍala 3); Jamadagni Bhārgava was a descendant of Bhṛgu (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Aṅgirasa is identified with Agni as the founder of a lineage of poet-singers (Maṇḍala 8); Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya (Maṇḍala 6); Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (Maṇḍala 7); Kaśyapa Mārīca (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Bhṛgu was the bringer of fire from heaven whose adoptive descendant was Gr̥tsamada Bhārgava Śaunaka (Maṇḍala 2).

  "mn95:17.3": "BB has “based on …”. But in the similar phrases at AN 4.117 and 5.114 it seems the meaning as i have given, and there BB has “things that provoke …” "
