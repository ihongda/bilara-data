  "mn51:1.2": "Campā is modern Champapur near Bhagalpur in Bihar state, not far from West Bengal. It is near the eastern-most reach of the Buddha’s journeys. Campā was the capital of Aṅga, one of the sixteen “great nations” (_mahājanapadā_). It was a flourishing trade center, and became a sacred city for the Jains. | _Gaggarā_, an onomatopoeic reduplication (“gargle”), is the name of a number of rivers and whirlpools in Sanskrit (cp. the modern Ghaggar River in north-west India). ",
  "mn51:1.3": "Neither of these appear elsewhere. ",
  "mn51:2.4": "Kandaraka’s status as a (non-Buddhist) wanderer does not preclude his faith in the Buddha. ",
  "mn51:3.1": "We do not hear anything about Kandaraka after this exchange. ",
  "mn51:4.3": "_Yāva supaññatta_ is also at [dn18:22.3](); it is a variation of the standard _yāva subhāsita_. ",
  "mn51:4.4": "The Buddha sometimes taught devotional meditations such as the six recollections for lay people, but passages such as this show there was no fundamental difference between lay and monastic meditations. ",
  "mn51:5.6": "“Mortifies themselves” is _attantapo_. ",
  "mn51:5.10": "“With self become divine” (_brahmabhūtena attanā_) deliberately echoes Upaniṣadic language. Pali is sometimes said to lack reference to the cosmic Brahman (in neuter), having only the personal Brahmā (in masculine). The grammatical case of _brahma-_ in the compound here is undetermined, yet no scholar of Sanskrit would hesitate to interpret the common phrase _brahmabhūtātmā_ in the sense “self become one with the cosmic divinity Brahman”. Surely the Pali draws from the same sense, using it to describe Nibbāna. ",
  "mn51:6.14": "Presumably Kandaraka left too. This sutta has an odd structure, as the bulk of the teaching occurs after the protagonists leave. This has the ring of a genuinely random encounter. ",
  "mn51:8.1": "For these practices, which were pursued by the Buddha before his awakening, see notes at [mn12:45.1](). ",
  "mn51:10.2": "The same vivid description of ritual is found at [mn94:12.2]() [an4.198:6.2](). "
