  "mn66:6.4": "This sutta distinguishes the “wrong time of day”, i.e. the afternoon, and the “wrong time of night”, i.e. any time when it is dark. The common expression “eating at night and at the wrong time” ([mn27:13.9]()) thus refers to both these periods. The Vinaya rule defines _vikāla_ for the purpose of this rule to include both afternoon and nighttime ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37:2.1.5]()), and it is this understanding that prevails in the tradition. ",

It appears, however, to be related to the colloquial Sanskrit _attā_ “mother”. It makes better sense to accept _ātu_ and _mātu_ as synonyms for “mother”. | The commentary explains _mārī_ as _mata_ “dead”, but it’s not clear how having dead parents is relevant. I think the point is that she sees herself as the “mother” who is “scared to death”. Thus take _mārī_ as an agent noun, “killer”. ",
