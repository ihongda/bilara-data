  "mn84:1.1": "The fact that the Buddha is not mentioned usually signifies a discourse set after his passing, which is confirmed towards the end of this sutta. ",
  "mn84:1.2": "Madhurā (Sanskrit Mathurā), located between modern Agra and Delhi, was the capital of Sūrasena on the north-western trade route. Painted Grey Ware at the site attests to its settlement in the Vedic era, long before the Buddha’s day with its characteristic Northen Black Polished Ware, which is also found there. Early suttas place the Buddha on the road to Madhurā [an4.43](), and attribute one short sutta where he rather uncharacteristically complained about how bad it was [an5.220](). SA 36 in Chinese translation places him at the Umbrella Mango Tree Park on the bank of the Bhadra River, where he gave a discourse whose Pali parallel is in Sāvatthī ([sn22.43]()). Despite its minor role in early Buddhism, it soon became a major Buddhist center, and as spiritual home of the great arahants Śaṇavāsin, Upagupta, and Moggaliputtatissa played a major role in spreading Buddhism. ",
  "mn84:2.1": "Avanti’s capital Ujjeni lay 600km south of Madhurā. The commentary explains that the former king of Avanti had married the sister of Pajjota, king of Avanti, hence their son was named “Son of Avanti”. The unification of their houses was, according to the Purānas, in fact a reunification, as both descended from the lunar Yadava lineage. The Yadavas were said to have settled as far as the key port on the Arabian sea at Dvāraka. Avantiputta, however, is not attested outside of this sutta, for which the Chinese parallel says rather, “the king of Mathurā, a western prince”. ",
  "mn84:2.2": "",
  "mn84:4.1": "Kaccāna appears in Madhurā also at [an2.38](), where he has a discussion on a similar topic with the brahmin Kandarāyana. Kaccāna often stayed at Avanti, both before and after the Buddha’s passing, where he also dealt with the question of the status of the brahimns ([sn35.132]()). The commentary says he was in fact the son of the chief priest (_purohita_) of Avanti, which would explain his connection with Avanti, his discussions on the topic of brahminhood, and his skill in analyzing scripture. Kaccāna ultimately established Buddhism in the region, from where it was later brought to Sri Lanka by another “son of Avanti”, the great monk Mahinda. ",
  "mn84:4.5": "“Rightful” is _orasa_, literally “of the bosom”. It signifies a legitimate natural heir. ",
  "mn84:6.5": "_Arahataṁ_ is genitive plural. "
