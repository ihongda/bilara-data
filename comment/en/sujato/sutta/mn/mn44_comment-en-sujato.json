  "mn44:1.3": "These two are little-known, in contrast with the previous _vedalla_ featuring a dialogue between two mendicants renowned for their wisdom. | Dhammadinnā was recognized as the foremost bhikkhunī in teaching ([an1.239:1.1]()), presumably on the basis of this sutta, and has a single verse to her name ([thig1.12]()). | Visākha is otherwise unmentioned in the canon. The commentary says this is not the same person as the mendicant known as Visākha, Pañcāli’s son ([thag2.45](), [an4.48](), [sn21.7]()). ",
  "mn44:2.1": "The normal form of address for nuns is _ayyā_ (“ma’am”), from the root _ariya_ (“noble”); the masculine form is occasionally used for monks as well. | “Substantial reality” is _sakkāya_, from _sat_ (“real”) and _kāya_ (“substance”). The Jain form is _astikāya_, which refers to the five fundamental substances (or ontological categories) comprised of the medium of motion, the medium of rest, space, soul, and matter (Bhagavatīsūtra 1.10). Note that the suttas use _kāya_, in the sense of “substance” or “mass”, as a key doctrinal term for ascetic movements associated with Jainism (eg. [dn2:23.3](), [dn2:26.2]()), whereas _kāya_ appears to have had no philosophical importance in pre-Buddhist Vedic texts. The commentaries define _sakkāya_ as “the three planes of cyclic existence”, i.e. all that exists. Thus _sakkāya_ is the “substantial reality” that is mistakenly assumed to be a “self”. ",
  "mn44:2.3": "Sāriputta also quotes the Buddha as saying this at [sn38.15:1.3](), both sources apparently drawing from [sn22.105:1.5]() and [sn22.103:1.6](). ",
  "mn44:3.3": "This treats “substantial reality” in terms of the four noble truths, a method also followed in multiple places such as [an4.33:2.2](), [sn22.103:1.4](), [sn22.105:1.2](), and [sn22.78:4.1](). ",
  "mn44:6.3": "In the suttas, the five aggregates are not presented as a catch-all category that encompasses all of reality, but rather five things that provoke attachment, forming the basis for attachment to self. Desire is what drives the formation of attachment, but it requires all the aggregates to function. Thus the “grasping” aggregates are numbered “five” after the model of the hand that grasps. ",
  "mn44:11.1": "This refers to the “three spectrums” of ethics, immersion, and wisdom (eg. [an3.143:2.3](); referred to as a set of three at [dn10:1.6.1](), and with the addition of _vimutti_ at [dn33:1.11.145])). “Spectrum” here is _khandha_ (elsewhere “aggregate”). ",
  "mn44:24.2": "“Change” doesn’t really work for viparinama here. I’m eating a yoghurt—yum! Someone gives me an ice-cream—yummier! Same for below; changing from one form of torture to another is not pleasant. Viparinama usually means “perish”, and so it must be here. "
