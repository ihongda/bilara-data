  "mn96:2.1": "This brahmin appears only here, and there is little to distinguish him personally. A king of the same name features in a Jātaka ([ja509]()). Could _esukārī_ be equivalent to _ayaskārī_, “blacksmith”? ",
  "mn96:3.4": "Manusmṛti 2.238 ff. allows that in abnormal times a brahmin may receive teachings from lower castes, except menials. ",
  "mn96:3.14": "Vāsiṣṭha Dharmasūtra 2.20 says that the role of a menial is to serve the other castes (_teṣāṁ paricaryā_). ",
  "mn96:4.4": "The reference to “these” ascetics and brahmins intrudes here, since none have been mentioned. In the parallel passage at [an6.57:9.4]() it fits, so it may well have come from there. ",
  "mn96:7.8": "The commentary explains (_uḷāravaṇṇatā_) as “high class”. That may be correct, but normally in Pali it refers to beauty ([dn18:10.1](), [ja458:15.3](), [vv29:1.1]()). ",
  "mn96:10.10": "This seems odd. At DN 5 this is attributed to a king, i.e. a khattiya. ",
