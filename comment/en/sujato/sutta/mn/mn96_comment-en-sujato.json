  "mn96:2.1": "This brahmin appears only here, and there is little to distinguish him personally. A king of the same name features in a Jātaka ([ja509]()). Could _esukārī_ be equivalent to _ayaskārī_, “blacksmith”? ",
  "mn96:4.4": "The reference to “these” ascetics and brahmins intrudes here, since none have been mentioned. In the parallel passage at [an6.57:9.4]() it fits, so it may well have come from there. ",
  "mn96:7.8": "For vanna here, take your pick: beauty, class, fame. Comm has class, BB has beauty. ularavanna only appears once elsewhere at DN 18, where it could mean any of these, but most likely beauty. Ulara is somewhat distantly applied to vanna as beauty also at AN 5.43. Finally, in a number of suttas we have the abstract vannata, which always seems to mean beauty. ",
  "mn96:10.10": "This seems odd. At DN 5 this is attributed to a king, i.e. a khattiya. ",
