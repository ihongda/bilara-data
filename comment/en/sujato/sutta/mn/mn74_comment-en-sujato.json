  "mn74:2.1": "Dīghanakha (“Long-nails”)  appears only here in early texts. He was Sāriputta’s nephew, according to a tradition found in both Pali commentaries and northern texts such as Mahāprajñāpāramitā-upadeśa-śāstra, Mahāvibhāṣā, and Avadānaśataka. ",
  "mn74:2.4": "Dīghanakha’s view “nothing is acceptable to me” (_sabbaṁ me nakkhamati_) is obscure, which seems to be the point. Sanskrit and Tibetan parallels to this passage are identical to the Pali, so when some Chinese translations say “no view” or “no teaching” is acceptable, this is probably because the translators felt the need to clarify, echoing the common expression, “the acceptance of a view after consideration” (_diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti_). This reading fits the text, but the sense may be broader than that. The closest phrasing in Pali is at [dn25:10.11](), where “this is not acceptable to me” (_idaṁ me nakkhamati_) refers to food that a picky monk rejects. Views about acceptable food are especially prominent in Jainism, which has a complex set of rules governing what may be eaten. Strictness in such matters is seen as a sign of virtue, escalating ultimately to the refusal of all food. ",

  "mn74:9.2": "For _kāyanvayatā_ (“subservience to the body”) see [mn36:4.4](). The inclusion of this rare phrase here suggests that Jain-like practices such as starvation may be indicated. "
