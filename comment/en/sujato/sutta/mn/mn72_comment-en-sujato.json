{
  "mn72:1.1": "This sutta depicts Vacchagotta, having gained a degree of faith as depicted in [mn71](), question the Buddha regarding the undeclared points. This is just a taste of Vacchagotta’s curiosity, as the 55 suttas of SN 33 all deal with the same topic, as do [sn44.7](), [sn44.8](), and [sn44.11](). Underlying all these questions is the assumption of a self, which Vacchagotta asks directly about at [sn44.10](). ",
  "mn72:15.9": "Mathita seems to only occur here in this sense. BB and Ṭhānissaro have excogitations, which, apart from being obscure, has the wrong sense: “To consider or think (something) out carefully and thoroughly.” Horner has “supposing”, apparently taking it as a straight synonym for mannati. But at Thag 14.2 it clearly means “oppressed, weighed down”, and the same sense probably applies at Thag 1.102, too. So “burdens, anxieties, worries”. ",
  "mn72:18.1": "Vacchagotta’s confusion on this same point is addressed at [sn44.9:5.3](). ",
  "mn72:22.2": "Vacchagotta had already gone forth as a wanderer, so it is surprising that he calls himself a “lay follower” (_upāsaka_ ). The Chinese parallels simply say that he left without taking refuge (SA 962 at T ii 246a17 and SA2 196 at T ii 445c8). Given that the Pali tradition repeats him going for refuge in the next sutta ([mn73:15.2]()), it seems likely that this detail was added by mistake here. "
