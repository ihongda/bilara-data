{
  "mn72:1.1": "This sutta depicts Vacchagotta, having gained a degree of faith as depicted in [mn71](), question the Buddha regarding the undeclared points. This is just a taste of Vacchagotta’s curiosity, as the 55 suttas of SN 33 all deal with the same topic, as do [sn44.7](), [sn44.8](), and [sn44.11](). Underlying all these questions is the assumption of a self, which Vacchagotta asks directly about at [sn44.10](). ",
  "mn72:15.2": "The Buddha has no “convictions” (_diṭṭhigata_), i.e. fixed views since his “right view” is grounded in experience. ",
  "mn72:15.9": "_Mathita_ is unusual. At [thag14.2]() it clearly means “oppressed, weighed down”, and the same sense probably applies at [thag1.102](), too. At [dhp349]() the root sense of “churn” fits well, while at [mn90:12.14]() it refers to starting a fire by churning with a drill. ",
  "mn72:18.1": "Vacchagotta’s confusion on this same point is addressed at [sn44.9:5.3](). ",
  "mn72:22.2": "Vacchagotta had already gone forth as a wanderer, so it is surprising that he calls himself a “lay follower” (_upāsaka_ ). The Chinese parallels simply say that he left without taking refuge (SA 962 at T ii 246a17 and SA2 196 at T ii 445c8). Given that the Pali tradition repeats him going for refuge in the next sutta ([mn73:15.2]()), it seems likely that this detail was added by mistake here. "
