  "mn79:5.4": "Cp. [sn56.39:1.2](). At [dn2:35.2]() this is the attitude of a servant to the king. ",
  "mn79:5.5": "The same phrase is used of the Buddha’s assembly at [mn77:6.64](), but with a different attitude: the Buddha’s assembly is poised expectantly, while Udāyī’s is gazing up at his face. ",
  "mn79:6.4": "For the Mahāsaṅgīti _sati_ (“reminded”), PTS reads _pīti_ here, but the phrase occurs at [mn89:4.2]() and [dn9:6.32](), both times with _sati_. ",
  "mn79:6.7": "The same claim is recorded at [mn14:17.2](). ",
  "mn79:7.7": "The Buddha does not claim to see every fact and detail, but he comprehends the principle that underlies all suffering. ",
  "mn79:8.1": "_Attabhāva_ is literally “the state of the self”, and refers to the body in which consciousness has been incarnated. While _attā_ usually has a psychological or metaphysical sense, it sometimes means the “body”, a usage found also in the Sanskrit _atman_ (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.2.4). ",
  "mn79:8.3": "The curious mud-goblin (_paṁsupisācaka_) is similarly mentioned at [ud4.4:7.3](). ",
  "mn79:18.1": "Ābhā nanubhonti is glossed in MN 79 as obhāsaṁ na vaḷañjanti. This is a difficult term, but acc. to PTS dict means “leave a mark”. In AN 4.127 the same phrase is glossed pabhā nappahonti, i.e. “light is ineffective”. Neither gloss supports “matches” or “reaches”. ",
  "mn79:21.2": "Vā is frequently conjunctive, and I think this makes more sense here. ",
  "mn79:27.3": "BB’s “dwells” for santitthati is misleading. In a parallel passage in AN 8.54 he has “associates”. "
