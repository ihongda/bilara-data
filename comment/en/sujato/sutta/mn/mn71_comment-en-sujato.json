  "mn71:1.1": "This begins the “Vacchagotta trilogy”, a series of three suttas tracing Vacchagotta’s spiritual development. In this sutta he shows an attitude of curiosity and respect, and gains a degree of faith in the Buddha. ",
  "mn71:5.1": "At [an3.57]() he similarly asks the Buddha to confirm his teachings on generosity. At [sn44.9](), meanwhile, he asks a somewhat related question about the six ascetic teachers and their divining of afterlife destinies. ",
  "mn71:5.2": "Such extraordinary claims were not unprecedented, as both the Jain leader Mahāvīra ([mn14:17.2]()) and Pūraṇa Kassapa [an9.38:2.1]() are said to claim omniscience in the Pali canon. Following Vacchagotta’s example, we should not take such reports on face value, but see whether they are confirmed by their own words. Extant Jain texts have no shortage of such claims (eg. Sūyagaḍa1.6, Kalpasūtra 1, Bhagavatisūtra 4.10, etc.), and it seems likely that this was part of Mahāvīra’s teachings. Sources for Pūraṇa Kassapa are slim, but he was regarded as a great teacher of the Ājīvakas, whose founder the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla was said to be omniscient (Basham, *History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas*, 275–6). ",
  "mn71:5.5": "Despite this, after the Buddha’s death the traditions soon asserted the Buddha’s omniscience. ",
  "mn71:6.2": "The Buddha’s knowledge is specific and functional: it serves the purpose of liberation. ",
  "mn71:11.2": "Note that this is phrased in the abstract, not about any particular people. ",
  "mn71:14.2": "This is the time of the Buddha Vipassī ([dn14:1.4.1]()). "
