  "mn71:5.1": "At [an3.57]() he similarly asks the Buddha to confirm his teachings on generosity. At [sn44.9](), meanwhile, he asks a somewhat related question about the six ascetic teachers and their divining of afterlife destinies. ",
  "mn71:5.2": "In the Pali texts, the Jain leader Mahāvīra ([mn14:17.2]()) and the Pūraṇa Kassapa [an9.38:2.1]() are said to make this claim. Following Vacchagotta’s example, we should not take such reports on face value, but see whether they are confirmed by their own words. Extant Jain texts have no shortage of such claims (eg. Sūyagaḍa1.6, Kalpasūtra 1, Bhagavatisūtra 4.10, etc.), and it seems likely that this was part of Mahāvīra’s teachings. Sources for Pūraṇa Kassapa are slim, but he was regarded as a great teacher of the Ājīvakas, whose founder the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla was said to be omniscient (Basham, *History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas*, 275–6).

  "mn71:11.2": "Note that while BB translates as if a pp, hence referring to historical fact, the text itself is phrased as an abstract question. ",
