  "mn71:1.1": "This begins the “Vacchagotta trilogy”, a series of three suttas tracing Vacchagotta’s spiritual development. In this sutta he shows an attitude of curiosity and respect, and gains a degree of faith in the Buddha. ",
  "mn71:5.1": "At [an3.57]() he similarly asks the Buddha to confirm his teachings on generosity. At [sn44.9](), meanwhile, he asks a somewhat related question about the six ascetic teachers and their divining of afterlife destinies. ",
  "mn71:5.2": "Such extraordinary claims were not unprecedented, as both the Jain leader Mahāvīra ([mn14:17.2]()) and Pūraṇa Kassapa [an9.38:2.1]() are said to claim omniscience in the Pali canon. Following Vacchagotta’s example, we should not take such reports on face value, but see whether they are confirmed by their own words. Extant Jain texts have no shortage of such claims (eg. Sūyagaḍa1.6, Kalpasūtra 1, Bhagavatisūtra 4.10, etc.), and it seems likely that this was part of Mahāvīra’s teachings. Sources for Pūraṇa Kassapa are slim, but he was regarded as a great teacher of the Ājīvakas, whose founder the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla was said to be omniscient (Basham, *History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas*, 275–6). ",
  "mn71:5.5": "At [an4.24:2.1]() the Buddha claims to know whatever is “seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind”, which is a complete knowledge of subjective experience. In the curious dialogue at [mn90:8.5]() the Buddha denies that anyone “will know” all things simultaneously. The Milindapañha reversed this to the positive statement that the Buddha could know all things, just not simultaneously ([mil5.1.2:1.2]()). The Buddha’s omniscience became the standard view of the later books of the Pali canon ([cnd10:5.2](), [bv2:55.3](), [pp1.6:2.1](), [kv3.1:5.3](), etc.). ",
  "mn71:6.2": "The Buddha’s knowledge is specific and functional: it serves the purpose of liberation. ",
  "mn71:11.2": "Note that this is phrased in the abstract, not about any particular people. | Vacchagotta uses the phrase _gihisaṁyojana_ (“fetter of lay life”), for which compare the Buddha’s term _gehasita_, the thoughts and memories “of the lay life” ([mn21:6.2](), [mn119:4.7](), [mn125:23.5](), [mn137:9.3]()). See also [mn54](), where the external “signs” of a householder are connected with the fetters. ",
  "mn71:14.2": "This is the time of the Buddha Vipassī ([dn14:1.4.1]()). "
