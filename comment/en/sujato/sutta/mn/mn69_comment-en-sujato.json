  "mn69:2.1": "Gulissāni (variant Goliyāni) is only known here. | The term _padasamācaro_ (Mahāsaṅgīti editions) or _padarasamācāro_ (Buddha Jayanthi, PTS, and Thai editions) is unique and uncertain. The commentary does not gloss it linguistically, but explains, “of weak conduct, of coarse conduct”. The reading _padara_ is preferred in Cone’s *Dictionary of Pali* in the sense “cleft”. But I propose we read with Sanskrit _padra_, “village”. This explains the confusion in Pali readings, as the Sanskrit is midway between _pada_ and _padara_. The point is that he was supposed to be a forest monk, yet he behaved as if he were from the village. ",
  "mn69:3.3": "“Autonomous” is _seri_, literally “self-moving”, i.e. living at one’s own pleasure like a deer ([thag19.1:54.1](); see [mn75:13.4]()). ",
  "mn69:4.1": "“Careful” is _kusala_, literally “skillful”. ",
  "mn69:4.4": "The PTS reading _ābhisamācārika_ here is spurious. ",
  "mn69:19.1": "This seems to be the only occurence of this phrase not given in full. And p[erhaps also the only place where it stands solely for arahantship. "
