  "mn69:2.1": "Gulissāni (variant Goliyāni) is only known here. | The term _padasamācaro_ (Mahāsaṅgīti editions) or _padarasamācāro_ (Buddha Jayanthi, PTS, and Thai editions) is unique and uncertain. The commentary does not gloss it linguistically, but explains, “of weak conduct, of coarse conduct”. The reading _padara_ is preferred in Cone’s *Dictionary of Pali* in the sense “cleft”.

  "mn69:5.1": "The perils of wandering the village at night are illustrated at [mn66:6.20](); see also [dn31:9.1](). ",
  "mn69:6.1": "Like the shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka at Kīṭāgiri ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13]()). ",
  "mn69:19.1": "Normally the “superhuman states” are in plural as they include absorptions, various advanced meditative abilities, and the stages of realization. Unusually the singular form here indicates arahantship. ",
  "mn69:19.9": "Those who live in a village are closer to temptations and need to be even more on their guards. "
