  "mn69:2.1": "Gulissāni (variant Goliyāni) is only known here. | The term _padasamācaro_ (Mahāsaṅgīti editions) or _padarasamācāro_ (Buddha Jayanthi, PTS, and Thai editions) is unique and uncertain. The commentary does not gloss it linguistically, but explains, “of weak conduct, of coarse conduct”. The reading _padara_ is preferred in Cone’s *Dictionary of Pali* in the sense “cleft”. But I propose we read as with Sanskrit _padra_, “village”. This explains the confusion in readings, as the Sanskrit is midway between the two Pali readings. The point is that he was supposed to be a forest monk, yet he behaved as if he were from the village. ",
  "mn69:4.4": "BB follows PTS in having abhisamacarika here. Surely this is a confusion in the text, and the MS version is correct. ",
  "mn69:19.1": "This seems to be the only occurence of this phrase not given in full. And p[erhaps also the only place where it stands solely for arahantship. "
