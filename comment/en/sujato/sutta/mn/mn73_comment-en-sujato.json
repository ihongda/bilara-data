  "mn73:1.1": "The final episode in the Vacchagotta trilogy sees our hero rise above his useless metaphysical quandaries and seek a better way to live. The Buddha’s patience is rewarded as Vacchagotta finally achieves his goal. ",
  "mn73:3.2": "After all the useless metaphysical quandaries, he finally asks for a simple way to practice. ",
  "mn73:4.1": "Elsewhere (eg. [mn9:4.1]()) a distinction is drawn between greed, hate, and delusion as the *root* of the unskillful, while the ten kinds of action are the unskillful (and the same applies to the skillful). ",
  "mn73:9.2": "Normally devoted layfolk would regularly keep the five precepts, which forbid sexual misconduct, and undertake the eight precepts, including celibacy, on the sabbath. However it seems that then, as today, there is a less formalized class of layfolk who would undertake the eight precepts continuously. The class of white-robed, celibate layfolk is mentioned in [dn29:12.11](), where it is a quality of a fully-developed and prosperous religion. Celibate laypeople are also referred to at [an5.180](), [an10.75:2.2](). Such layfolk have the potential to realize non-return, since that requires the complete letting god of all forms of desire. ",
  "mn73:28.7": "Vacchagotta’s attainment is also confirmed in his verse at [thag1.112](). "
