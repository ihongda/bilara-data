  "mn70:2.1": "Not eating at night was, it seems, a staple practice of ascetics, and as such is included in the Gradual Training ([mn27:13.9]()). The failure of mendicants to comply led to the laying down of a formal Vinaya rule ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37]()). But some came to regret their objections, recognizing that the Buddha had acted for their welfare ([mn66:6.4]()). | The related practice of eating in one sitting is, by contrast, not required in the Vinaya, but was encouraged ([mn21:7.4](), [mn65:2.1]()). ",
  "mn70:4.1": "Assaji and Punabbasuka were a pair of shameless monks known for corrupting lay folk with their superficial charm ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.2](), [pli-tv-kd11:13.1.1]()), and for misdirecting Sangha lodgings ([pli-tv-kd16:16.1.1]()). | Assaji is not to be confused with the good monk who was one of the first five mendicants ([mn35:3.1]()). ",
  "mn70:4.10": "They are twisting the meaning of well-known properties of the Dhamma, which is “apparent in the present” and “immediately effective” (_sandiṭṭhiko akāliko_, [mn7:6.2]()). In this they are following the example of Māra, who makes the exact same argument ([sn1.20:4.4](), [sn4.21:1.7]()). This is is a precursor to the modern critique of religion that offers “a pie in the sky when you die”. The fallacy is that it is sensual pleasures that take time—for they bind you to rebirth—whereas the Dhamma may be realized in this life. ",
  "mn70:6.18": "The Buddha, even in the face of such intransigence, begins by establishing common ground and giving encouragement. ",
  "mn70:8.2": "Having found an initial common ground, the Buddha takes time to establish that his teaching is grounded on experience. ",
  "mn70:15.2": "The arahant “freed both ways” is defined by their mastery of formless meditations, which they understand with wisdom ([dn15:36.3](), [an9.45]()). | “Direct meditative experience” is an oblique rendering of _kāyena phusitvā_, since in the “formless” meditations, _kāya_ cannot mean “body”. Like other meditative terms, the sense of the word gradually grows more subtle as meditation deepens. In preliminary passages it simply means “the body” as contemplated in meditation. As meditation deepens it takes more of a sense of experience as it happens in the body. Finally, as physical perception fades, _kāya_ loses any sense of materiality and simply means direct personal experience of meditative states or even of Nibbana. ",
  "mn70:16.2": "Of course they have practiced absorption, which is an essential part of the eightfold path. But because of their strong insight, they they have not needed to further develop the ultimate refinement of the formless attainments. ",
  "mn70:21.3": "Notice that even the least of the noble ones possesses the five spiritual faculties, which include absorption. ",
  "mn70:23.2": "Parallel passages at [an8.82:2.1]() and [an10.83:4.1]() add “ask questions” after “pay homage”, which seems preferable. ",
  "mn70:24.1": "After spending so long establishing common ground, finally the Buddha admonishes them. ",
  "mn70:25.3": "This idiomatic expression is paralleld at MN 95. Comm in neither case offers help. i translate according to the apparent meaning. "
