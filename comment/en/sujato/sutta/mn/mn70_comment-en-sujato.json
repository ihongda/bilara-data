  "mn70:2.1": "Not eating at night was, it seems, a staple practice of ascetics, and as such is included in the Gradual Training ([mn27:13.9]()). The failure of mendicants to comply led to the laying down of a formal Vinaya rule ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37]()). But some came to regret their objections, recognizing that the Buddha had acted for their welfare ([mn66:6.4]()). | The related practice of eating in one sitting is, by contrast, not required in the Vinaya, but was encouraged ([mn21:7.4](), [mn65:2.1]()).

  "mn70:4.1": "Assaji and Punabbasuka were a pair of shameless monks known for corrupting lay folk with their superficial charm ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.1.2](), [pli-tv-kd11:13.1.1]()), and for misdirecting Sangha lodgings ([pli-tv-kd16:16.1.1]()). | Assaji is not to be confused with the good monk who was one of the first five mendicants ([mn35:3.1]()).

  "mn70:4.10": "They are twisting the meaning of well-known properties of the Dhamma, which is “apparent in the present” and “immediately effective” (_sandiṭṭhiko akāliko_, [mn7:6.2]()). In this they are following the example of Māra, who makes the exact same argument ([sn1.20:4.4](), [sn4.21:1.7]()). This is is a precursor to the modern critique of religion that offers “a pie in the sky when you die”. The fallacy is that it is sensual pleasures that take time—for they bind you to rebirth—whereas the Dhamma may be realized in this life. ",
  "mn70:6.18": "The Buddha, even in the face of such intransigence, begins by establishing common ground and giving encouragement. ",
  "mn70:23.2": "Note that in parallel passages in AN 10.83 and AN 8.82, we have paripucchitā ca, ohitasoto ca dhammaṁ suṇāti, which seems preferable. ",
