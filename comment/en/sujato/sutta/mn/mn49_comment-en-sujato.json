  "mn49:2.2": "Baka maintains the same wrong view at [sn6.4](), where his past lives are revealed. In neither sutta is he said to go for refuge, although SN 6.4 does end with effusive praise of the Buddha. The word _baka_ means “stork” or “crane”. Far from being recognized as a high divinity in Brahmanism, he is a man-eating demon (_rakṣasa_) in bird form whose fate is to be slain by the hero Bhīma (or Kṛṣṇa). Pali Jātakas [ja38]() and [ja236]() tell of how the stork dozes peacefully as if meditating by the water, while in reality he is trying to fool fish into approaching. A cunning, large, white, high-flying, predatory bird who fakes meditation is a fitting image for the antagonist of this sutta. ",

Compare the saying of Uddaka son of Rāma at [sn35.103:1.6](). | For _idaṁ niccaṁ_ see _eṣa nityo_ (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.23); for _idaṁ dhuvaṁ_ see _etad apramayaṃ dhruvam_ (4.4.20). ",
