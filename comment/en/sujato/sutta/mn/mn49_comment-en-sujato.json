  "mn49:2.2": "Baka maintains the same wrong view at [sn6.4](), where his past lives are revealed. In neither sutta is he said to go for refuge, although SN 6.4 does end with effusive praise of the Buddha. The word _baka_ means “stork” or “crane”. Far from being recognized as a high divinity in Brahmanism, he is a man-eating demon (_rakṣasa_) in bird form whose fate is to be slain by the hero Bhīma (or Kṛṣṇa). Pali Jātakas [ja38]() and [ja236]() tell of how the stork dozes peacefully as if meditating by the water, while in reality he is trying to fool fish into approaching. A cunning, large, white, high-flying, predatory bird who fakes meditation is a fitting image for the antagonist of this sutta. ",

When tucch-, ritt-are used together like this, they almost always refer to speech, in the context of a debate or controverted claim. (MN 61, MN 80, MN 99, and so on). Only rarely are they used in an ontological sense, as in SN 22.95 and SN 35.238. But these are not debates. ",
