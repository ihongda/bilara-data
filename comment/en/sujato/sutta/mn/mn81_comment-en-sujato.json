  "mn81:3.1": "Each of the occasions when the Buddha smiled in this way served as an introduction to an uplifting story of the past. In [mn83](), the Buddha tells of the fabled king Makhādeva of Mithilā, who went forth and practice the divine meditations. [an5.180](), like the current sutta, tells the story of a virtuous layperson in the time of Kassapa Buddha. Both the Kassapa stories are set in Kosala. ",
  "mn81:6.5": "_Sādhusammata_ is normally an epithet of (real or supposed) saints. Here it is the *sight* (_dassana_) of the saint that is deemed holy. This is an early example of the belief known in Hinduism as _darshana_, that the sight of a holy person, place, or object was auspicious and conveyed blessings on the seer. This topic is also treated at [snp4.4]() and [an6.30](). ",
  "mn81:6.8": "",
  "mn81:6.16": "_Sotti_ is from Sanskrit _śukti_, “oyster shell”. It is mentioned by Varāhamihira as an ingredient in perfumed bath powders fit for a king (Bṛhat Saṃhitā 77). It is probably either powdered or ashen oyster shell, which is included as an exfoliant in some modern soaps, or else perfume from a plant whose leaves or flowers resemble oysters. However, the commentary, identifying it with the _kuruvindakasutti_ that is not allowed for mendicants ([pli-tv-kd15:1.3.18]()) evidently derives it from _sutta_ (“string”) and explains it as a string of perfumed resin-balls. ",
  "mn81:9.10": "Comm says “dokārahikārapikārā nipātā, yāvatuparimanti attho”, i.e. “the words do, hi, and pi are particles; the meanings is 'to this extent'. This is followed by all the translators I have checked (Bodhi, Horner, Chalmers) But dohi is “milking”, as in anavasesadohī 'milk dry', an idiom which is used in the similar sense of 'pushing the matter this far' in AN 11.7, etc. The English idiom 'to milk' in the sense of 'get all possible advantage from (a situation)' is similar enough that it is, i think, worth preserving the literal idiom. ",
  "mn81:16.1": "The description of the dish is unique, and uncertain. BB’s “rice in the sheaf”—based on comm—is hardly possible. Mudika in the sense of “soft” is the simplest reading (cf. sukaramaddava), while pandu may well refer to a yellowish colored “saffron” rice such as is common in India today. ",
  "mn81:17.6": "The king is promising that the offerings for the whole sangha in the vassa will be just as luxurious as the ones just offered. This statement echoes the Buddha’s statement near the end of the sutta, Evarūpo ca, mahārāja, ghaṭikāro kumbhakāro. The Buddha is emphasizing that it is the qualities of trust and conduct that he cares about in a lay devotee, not the luxury of the offerings. ",
  "mn81:18.11": "The same phrases is said of samana sakyaputta at SN 42.10 ",
  "mn81:18.12": "For musala, BB has “pick”. Clearly it is a digging implement of some kind. See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-the-austerities/3837 ",
  "mn81:19.3": "Bhaggava doesn’t mean “potter”, but rather “fire-master”. ",
  "mn81:22.1": "While supeyyam might seem to mean “sauce ingredients”, and is translated as “sauce materials” by BB, it is always used in the sense of “sauce”, eg at SN 47.8. The phrase tadupiyañca sūpeyyaṁ recurs at DN 17 and SN 22.96 where it must also refer to “sauce”. This means that the food that is sent is cooked food, not, as one might assume from the quantity, dry foodstuffs. This in turn supports the rejection of paṇḍupuṭaka in the sense of “rice in the sheaf”. "
