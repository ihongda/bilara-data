  "mn61:1.1": "This Buddha teaches his son Rāhula the dangers of lying, using gestures to illustrate his point. The simple subject matter and child-friendly methods support the commentary’s claim that this was when Rāhula was still a boy, soon after he ordained ([pli-tv-kd1:54.1.1]()). | This sutta is among those recommended for study by the Saṅgha by King Ashoka in Minor Rock Edict No. 3, the Calcutta-Bairāṭ rock inscription from Viratnagar in Rajasthan. There it is described as “the exhortation to Rāhula spoken by the blessed Buddha concerning falsehood” (_laghulo-vāde musā-vādaṃ adhigicya bhagavatā budhena bhāsite_). ",

  "mn61:8.4": "The Buddha illustrates the abstract concept of introspection with what is perhaps the most fundamental metaphor: the sight of one’s own face. See also Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.7.4 and Kaṭha Upaniṣad 2.3.5. ",

  "mn61:12.1": "The threefold checking of actions before, during, and after is emphasized in the Vinaya analysis of the rule against deliberate lying ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc1:2.2.2]()). "
