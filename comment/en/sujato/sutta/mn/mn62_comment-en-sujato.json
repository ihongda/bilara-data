  "mn62:2.2": "According to the commentary, Rāhula was now eighteen years old, situating this sutta several years after [mn61](). ",
  "mn62:3.3": "The commentary says that the Buddha admonished him because he was admiring his father’s beauty, thinking that he looked similar. See [mn61:8.2](), which similarly implies that vanity was a weakness of Rāhula. ",
  "mn62:4.1": "He decides to meditate rather than eat for that day. ",
  "mn62:5.1": "Rāhula would have still been a novice (_sāmeṇera_) as he was not yet twenty. It was Sāriputta who ordained him ([pli-tv-kd1:54.2.7]()). ",
  "mn62:7.1": "The Pali text has a striking narrative form. The Buddha encourages Rāhula to contemplate form; then Sāriputta urges him in breath meditation; but when Rāhula asks the Buddha about that, the Buddha ignores him (until much later in the sutta) and instead expands on his instructions on form. The Chinese parallel (EA 17.1 at T ii 581c–582c) paints quite a different picture. Sāriputta does not appear at all, and it is the Buddha who instructs Rāhula when he is meditating, teaching him not just mindfulness of breathing but also the meditations on the ugliness of the body and the divine abidings. Then, when Rāhula approaches him later to ask further about mindfulness of breathing, the Buddha teaches him this right away, omitting entirely the long section on the elements. Both suttas agree on teaching Rāhula a range of meditations, but the Pali implies that he needed to mature his mind with a range of other meditations before attempting mindfulness of breathing, a situation of which Sāriputta was not aware. ",
  "mn62:8.1": "This largely follows [mn140:14.4]() and [mn28:4.1](), the latter of which was taught by Sāriputta. There the expanded teaching is clearly situated within the contemplation of form, whereas here it is somewhat abrupt. ",
  "mn62:8.2": "[mn28:4.1]() ",
  "mn62:13.3": "This simile and those that follow on water, fire, and wind are found at [an9.11:4.1](), where they are also spoken by Sāriputta. ",
  "mn62:15.3": "",
  "mn62:17.3": "This phrase is unique in the early texts. It is quoted by name in [mil7.4.6:5.4](), showing that the sutta in its current form must have existed by then. This is not surprising, as that portion of the Milinda was probably composed half a millennium after the Buddha. ",
