  "mn62:2.2": "According to the commentary, Rāhula was now eighteen years old, situating this sutta several years after [mn61](). ",
  "mn62:3.3": "The commentary says that the Buddha admonished him because he was admiring his father’s beauty, thinking that he looked similar. See [mn61:8.2](), which similarly implies that vanity was a weakness of Rāhula. ",
  "mn62:4.1": "He decides to meditate rather than eat for that day. ",
  "mn62:5.1": "Rāhula would have still been a novice (_sāmeṇera_) as he was not yet twenty. It was Sāriputta who ordained him ([pli-tv-kd1:54.2.7]()). ",
  "mn62:7.1": "The Pali text has a striking narrative form. The Buddha encourages Rāhula to contemplate form; then Sāriputta urges him in breath meditation; but when Rāhula asks the Buddha about that, the Buddha ignores him (until much later in the sutta) and instead expands on his instructions on form. This implies that the Buddha had a specific purpose in mind that Sāriputta was not aware of. The Chinese parallel (EA 17.1 at T II 581c-582c), however, paints quite a different picture. There, Sāriputta does not appear at all, and it is the Buddha who instructs Rāhula when he is meditating, teaching him not just mindfulness of breathing but also the meditations on the ugliness of the body and the divine abidings. Then, when Rāhula approaches him later to ask further about mindfulness of breathing, the Buddha teaches him this right away, omitting entirely the long section on the elements. ",
  "mn62:8.1": "This largely follows [mn140:14.4]() and [mn28:4.1](), the latter of which was taught by Sāriputta. There the expanded teaching is clearly situated within the contemplation of form, whereas here it is somewhat abrupt. ",
  "mn62:8.2": "[mn28:4.1]() ",
  "mn62:13.3": "This simile and those that follow are found at [an9.11:4.1](), where they are also spoken by Sāriputta. ",

  "mn62:30.2": "PTS’s assasapassasa must be correct, for why else is nirujjhanti plural? "
