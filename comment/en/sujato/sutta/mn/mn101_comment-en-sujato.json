  "mn101:1.2": "Devadaha also appears in [sn22.2]() and [sn35.134](). It is explained in Pali as meaning “lake of the gods”, taking _daha_ as equivalent to the Sanskrit _hrada_, “lake”. However it is spelled _devadṛśa_ in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, where _dṛśa_ means “sight, appearance”, a word commonly used in the Rig Veda of the fiery gleam of Agni (3.17.4, 6.10.4, 7.1.1, etc.). This suggests a Pali derivation from √_ḍah_, “to burn”, recalling Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.4.1.14, which allegorically depicts the spread of Aryan culture eastward as Agni “burning” (_dadāha_) the lands, i.e. introducing the civilized practice of Vedic fire worship. It became famous in later Buddhism as the birthplace of the sisters Māyā and Mahāpajāpatī of the Koliyan clan, the Buddha’s birth mother and foster mother. These details are not mentioned in early texts, however, where the town is said to be Sakyan rather than Koliyan. It is identified with Devdaha in the Rupandehi District of Nepal. ",
  "mn101:15.3": "This is a difficult sentence, and different translators handle it in quite different ways. I take vipaccetha as second plural optative, intended as a rhetorical question. The sense, I think, plays on the common meaning of “ripen”, but in the sense “make something out of it that it isn’t”, i.e. (mis)construe. ",
  "mn101:18.1": "BB’s translation is based on Abhidhamma via comm, and is incorrect. ",
  "mn101:22.12": "PTS edition has the expected papa. ",
  "mn101:23.4": "BB takes viraga here in the sense of “fade away”, but it seems hard then to differentiate it from nijjinna. In addition, in the simile viraga is used in the sense of dispassion. Thus I think that is the sense here, too. "
