  "mn101:1.2": "Devadaha also appears in [sn22.2]() and [sn35.134](). It is famous in later Buddhism as the birthplace of the sisters Māyā and Mahāpajāpatī, the Buddha’s birth mother and foster mother, although these details are not mentioned in early texts. ",
  "mn101:15.3": "This is a difficult sentence, and different translators handle it in quite different ways. I take vipaccetha as second plural optative, intended as a rhetorical question.

  "mn101:22.12": "PTS edition has the expected papa. ",
  "mn101:23.4": "BB takes viraga here in the sense of “fade away”, but it seems hard then to differentiate it from nijjinna. In addition, in the simile viraga is used in the sense of dispassion. Thus I think that is the sense here, too. "
