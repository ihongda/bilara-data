  "mn77:2.2": "The Buddha addresses these wanderers at [an4.30](), where he teaches four fundamental principles of any holy life, and at [an4.185](), where he teaches four “truths of the brahmins”. These are all respectful engagements that highlight common ground. | Annabhāra means “food-carrier” and indicates a humble origin ([thag16.9:19.1]()). | Varadhara means “bearer of good fortune”; it is probably a name for the earth. | Sakuludāyī also appears in [mn79](). His name (“one who rises up with his own family”) is ironic, given that his attempt to go forth is frustrated by his followers. ",

  "mn77:6.33": "Taking _dhamma_ here in the sense of “right, legitimate”, rather than “teaching”, as the example criticizes him not his teaching. ",
  "mn77:6.65": "_Khuddā_ (literally “small one”) is said to be a species of small bee, also known in Sanskrit as _kṣudrā_. The “dwarf bee” (_apis florea_) fits the bill, as it is a small wild honeybee found in India. ",
  "mn77:6.70": "For “having clashed” (_sampayojetvā_), see [sn11.24:1.2](). ",
  "mn77:8.1": "This is an example of what the Buddha says in [dn1:1.7.1](), “When an ordinary person speaks praise of the Realized One, they speak only of trivial, insignificant details of mere ethics.” ",
  "mn77:9.5": "For Mahāsṅgīti _satthalūkhāni_ accept PTS and BJT reading _yattha lūkhāni_. | _Alābu_ is “bottle gourd”, which is covered in a fine down. ",

  "mn77:12.6": "This is a good example of why _sappāṭihāriya_ means “with demonstrable basis”, not “with miracles”. ",
  "mn77:13.3": "_Vādapatha_ is found here and at [an4.8:5.1]() in the sense of “criticism”. Compare _vacanapatha_, which is always used in the sense of “harsh words”, “criticism” (eg. [an4.114:9.2]()). Compare English “give a talking to”, “have words with”. At snp5.7:8.5, however, _vādapatha_ is used in the sense “ways of speech”. ",
