  "mn85:2.1": "The commentary says that Bodhi’s father was Udena, king of Kosambi, while his mother was Vāsuladattā, daughter of King Pajjota of Avanti, whose marriage became one of the great romantic legends of Indian story. Bodhi would then be the first cousin once removed of King Avantiputta of Madhurā ([mn84]()). It seems that the Bhaggas were vassals of the Vacchas of Kosambi, so Bodhi as prince of Kosambi dwelt there as suzerain. ",

  "mn85:7.17": "The Buddha evidently wished to avoid setting a precedent of treating mendicants as if they conveyed blessings by their mere step. ",

This lends support to the Jain tradition that claims Bodhi’s grandfather Pajjota as a disciple. It would often be the case that ruling families would patronize all religions. ",
  "mn85:10.2": "The Buddha confirms that this Jain view drove his practices before awakening. ",
  "mn85:55.5": "According to the commentary, it was Pajjota’s desire to learn the art of training elephants from Bodhi’s father Udena that, after a colorful series of events, ultimately led to the joining of their houses and the birth of Bodhi. While the story is framed as a romantic adventure, it shows the strategic importance of trained elephants for royal power. ",
  "mn85:58.1": "_Padhāna_ is literally to “fix” or “place” and hence to “try” or “strive”. Its core application is to apply oneself to spiritual practices, and hence in Buddhism it overlaps in meaning with “meditation”; a _padhānasāla_ is a “meditation hall”. Here the five factors are qualities that are essential foundations for meditation. ",
  "mn85:61.6": "Quotes in MS are incorrect. "
