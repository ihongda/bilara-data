  "mn85:2.1": "The commentary says that Bodhi’s father was Udena, king of Kosambi, while his mother was Vāsuladattā, daughter of King Pajjota of Avanti, whose marriage became one of the great romantic legends of Indian story. Bodhi would then be the first cousin once removed of King Avantiputta of Madhurā ([mn84]()). It seems that the Bhaggas were vassals of the Vacchas of Kosambi, so Bodhi as prince of Kosambi dwelt there as suzerain. ",
  "mn85:7.13": "With just a glance Ānanda knew what to do. ",
  "mn85:7.17": "The Buddha evidently wished to avoid setting a precedent of treating mendicants as if they conveyed blessings by their mere step. ",
  "mn85:9.1": "The discourse thus far is also found at [pli-tv-kd15:21.1.1](). The Vinaya version omits the following teaching, and instead provides an occasion for the Buddha to make it a minor offence to step on a cloth covering ([pli-tv-kd15:21.3.6]()). But following a complaint, the Buddha make an exception for stepping on a cloth for laypeople seeking blessings ([pli-tv-kd15:21.4.11]()). ",
  "mn85:9.5": "This is a Jain view ([mn14:20.1]()). This lends support to the Jain tradition that claims Bodhi’s grandfather Pajjota as a disciple. | Bodhi’s spirituality was inclusive, as he is close to the brahmin Sañjikāputta, inquires into Buddhism, asserts a Jain view, and practices superstitions. ",
  "mn85:10.2": "The Buddha confirms that this Jain view drove his practices before awakening. ",
  "mn85:55.5": "According to the commentary, it was Pajjota’s desire to learn the art of training elephants from Bodhi’s father Udena that, after a colorful series of events, ultimately led to the joining of their houses and the birth of Bodhi. While the story is framed as a romantic adventure, it shows the strategic importance of trained elephants for royal power. ",
  "mn85:58.1": "_Padhāna_ is literally to “fix” or “place” and hence to “try” or “strive”. Its core application is to apply oneself to spiritual practices, and hence in Buddhism it overlaps in meaning with “meditation”; a _padhānasāla_ is a “meditation hall”. Here the five factors are qualities that are essential foundations for meditation. ",
  "mn85:61.6": "His “lady mother” (_ayyā_), as noted above, was Queen Vāsuladattā, daughter of Pajjota and wife of Udena. | This is the only place in the Pali canon where the idiom “heard and learned this in the presence” is applied to anyone other than the Buddha. "
