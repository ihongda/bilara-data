  "mn100:2.2": "A brahmin  lady of the same name also trips and utters praise of the Buddha in [sn7.1](). Nonetheless, most other details of the stories are different, including the location and the subsequent teaching. There, her husband gets angry, goes to confront by the Buddha, but is converted by his teaching on the harm of anger. The historical relation between these two texts is unclear. Regardless, they do attest to the quasi-superstitious use of Buddhist invocations from an early date. A similar invocation is expressed for the Great Steward at [dn19:58.5](). ",
  "mn100:3.4": "BB omits _tevijjānaṁ_. ",
  "mn100:3.5": "_Tāta bhadramukha_ is unique, and I think it is deliberately condescending. “Oh, sweetie!” ",
  "mn100:5.5": "Text apparently drops extra ti by mistake, it should be “evam bhoti” ti. ",
  "mn100:42.2": "Here, _aṭṭhita_ is _ā+ṭhita_. ",
  "mn100:42.5": "The idiomatic instrumental _ṭhanaso_ is used in two ways in the suttas: “immediately, on the spot”, and “in terms of cause”, where it typically appears in the context of rebirth, and is followed by a verb of knowing (_ṭhānaso hetuso vipākaṁ yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti_). That this context is, in fact, about rebirth, is confirmed by the parallel phrase at mn90:13.2, which there is explained in terms of rebirth. The Buddha was phrasing his reply so as to avoid the implied metaphysical absolutism in the question. ",
  "mn100:42.13": "The Buddha made a mild logical leap, assuming that Saṅgārava would follow him. The slightly clumsy misunderstanding in this passage strikes me as quite naturalistic dialogue. "
