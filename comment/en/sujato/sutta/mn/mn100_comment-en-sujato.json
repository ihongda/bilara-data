  "mn100:2.2": "A brahmin  lady of the same name also trips and utters praise of the Buddha in [sn7.1](). Nonetheless, most other details of the stories are different, including the location and the subsequent teaching. There, her husband gets angry, goes to confront by the Buddha, but is converted by his teaching on the harm of anger. The historical relation between these two texts is unclear. Regardless, they do attest to the quasi-superstitious use of Buddhist invocations from an early date. A similar invocation is expressed for the Great Steward at [dn19:58.5](). ",

In the Sanskrit parallel, faith applies to all the means of knowledge, in the sense that they have faith in those means.

[mn12:11.2](), _ṭhānaso hetuso vipākaṁ yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti_, “understands results [of kamma] in terms of grounds and causes”). The Buddha’s point is that the survival of gods is not a metaphysical absolute but depends on their kamma. | As usual, the Buddha answers questions framed with _atthi_ indirectly; see note on [mn90:13.2](). | That _adhideva_ means “about the gods” is established at [mn90:17.8]().
