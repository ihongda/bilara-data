  "mn100:2.2": "A brahmin  lady of the same name also trips and utters praise of the Buddha in [sn7.1](). Nonetheless, most other details of the stories are different, including the location and the subsequent teaching. There, her husband gets angry, goes to confront by the Buddha, but is converted by his teaching on the harm of anger. The historical relation between these two texts is unclear. Regardless, they do attest to the quasi-superstitious use of Buddhist invocations from an early date. A similar invocation is expressed for the Great Steward at [dn19:58.5](). ",

  "mn100:7.6": "Elsewhere, reason and faith are regarded as two distinct means of knowledge (eg. [mn95:14.5]()), and their conflation here is probably a redaction error. In the Sanskrit parallel, faith applies to all the means of knowledge, in the sense that they have faith in those means.

  "mn100:42.5": "The idiomatic instrumental _ṭhanaso_ is used in two ways in the suttas: “immediately, on the spot”, and “in terms of cause”, where it typically appears in the context of rebirth, and is followed by a verb of knowing (_ṭhānaso hetuso vipākaṁ yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti_). In other words, the survival of gods depends on their kamma. That this context is, in fact, about rebirth, is confirmed by the parallel phrase at [mn90:13.2](). The Buddha was phrasing his reply so as to avoid the implied metaphysical absolutism in the question. | That _adhideva_ means “about the gods” is established at [mn90:17.8](). ",
