  "mn57:1.2": "The Koliyans were south-eastern neighbors of the Sakyans, with whom they had close ties in marriage and customs. | Haliddavasana (“yellow-clothes”) is also the scene of [sn45.54](), which discusses similarities and differences between Buddhism and wanderers when it comes to meditation.

  "mn57:2.1": "Only Seniya is said to be an ascetic, and only his behavior is actually described. Perhaps Puṇṇa’s observance was less rigorous. Indeed, while the cow-votary (_govatika_) is attested in Sanskrit literature (eg. Mahābhārata 5.97.13a), the description in Agni Purāna 292:12–13a (Gangadharan’s translation) does not require constant imitation: “One should bathe in the urine of a cow, maintain himself with milk, and move with the cows, eating after they had eaten. It is known as _govrata_. One would become free from the sins in a month. He would attain the world of cows and reach heaven.” | Elsewhere we also hear of snake votaries, fish votaries, those who live like beasts (_mṛgacaryā_), and others, but not, so far as I am aware, dog votaries.
