  "mn102:2.2": "The term _aroga_ (“free of disease”) is explained by the commentary as “permanent” (_nicca_), drawing on the root sense of the word, “unbroken”. However, _aroga_ is always used in the sense “free of disease, well, healthy” (eg. [mn97:2.4]()), and this applies to the Brahmanical tradition as well as the Buddhist. Chandogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2 says that one who sees (the self) does not see death, they have no disease or pain. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.12 similarly says that one who sees the self will not suffer in the wake of the body, which Śaṅkāra explains, “Struggling with desires for himself, for his son, for his wife, and so on, he is born and dies again and again, and is diseased when his body is diseased.” ",

  "mn102:11.3": "BB has “rushing onward” for _uddhaṁ saraṁ_, while Horner has “loftily maintain attachment”. But it seems to me this is related to the common phrase _uddhaṁsoto_, i.e. heading upstream, i.e. getting reborn in a higher realm. See snp4.13:7.3. "
