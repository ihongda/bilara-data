  "mn94:1.1": "As usual, the lack of mention of the Buddha at the start suggests that this sutta is set after his passing away, a detail confirmed at the end. ",
  "mn94:1.2": "Neither monk nor monastery are mentioned elsewhere in early texts. ",
  "mn94:2.1": "Ghoṭamukha (“Beard-face”), a wealthy brahmin sponsored by the King of Aṅga, may be the Ghoṭamukha cited in Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 5.5.11. On the question of when a courtier should know that his king is displeased with him, a series of expert opinions are cited, each one bewilderingly cryptic. Ghoṭamukha says such a king is like a “wet cloth”. The key to these clues is provided in a particular story, which is deliberately unmentioned, presumably because of the delicacy of the subject. ",
  "mn94:2.6": "_Ambho samaṇa_  (“mister ascetic”) is a unique form of address. I think it is deliberately clumsy, a sign that Ghotamukha, having never met a monk before, doesn’t really know the right way to address them. ",
  "mn94:2.8": "His opinion is untempered by knowledge. ",
  "mn94:8.1": "Punctuation in MS is incorrect, compare the parallel phrasing in MN 43 ",
  "mn94:8.5": "BB’s “in order to learn” is not supported by comm. Nor is anuggaha used in the sense of “learn “, so far as I know, only as” support, help “. Comm: Sānuggahā vācā bhāsitā sakāraṇā vācā bhāsitā. Vuttañhetaṁ mayā ‘‘amhākaṁ kathā appamāṇaṁ, dhammova pamāṇa’’nti.” Sānuggahā vācā bhāsitā means “what was spoken was with reason. For I said that thinking:” our speech is limitless, but the teaching is limited.” ",
  "mn94:33.1": "niccabhikkha is a curious idiom, not, so far as I know, discussed in any available dictionary. In Ja 398 it refers to the daily offering of food to a yakkha, and this must be the early meaning. here and at SN 3.13 it is explicitly said to refer to money, so this must have evolved. the fact that Udena has to ask what kind of offering it is shows that it still might have meant food. ",
  "mn94:33.3": "At SN 3.13 it is one hundred kahapanas. Both these are in the ballpark of what might be “dollars” today. ",
  "mn94:33.5": "BB has “monastery”, but vihara means “dwelling” in the EBTs. Moreoever, he would hardly have built a whole monastery for one monk. ",
  "mn94:33.6": "Showing the shift of locus for the Sangha after the Buddha died. "
