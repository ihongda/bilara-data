  "mn76:2.1": "Neither Sandaka nor this location appear to be known elsewhere. ",
  "mn76:3.2": "Evidently an excursion for sightseeing was popular. As well as simply enjoying nature, such trips give the mendicants a chance to check out possible places to stay for meditation. ",
  "mn76:4.7": "This sentence is redundant as it stands. But wherever this idiom occurs elsewhere, it specifies that the person is a lay disciple ([dn25:3.5](), [mn78:3.7](), [an10.93:2.7](), [an10.94:3.4]()). Perhaps the text here has been corrupted and originally specified that Ānanda was a *monastic* disciple. ",
  "mn76:6.1": "_Anassāsika_ (“unreliable”) normally describes “conditions”, where it is a synonym of _anicca_ and _adhuva_ ([an7.66:2.3](), [dn17:2.16.4](), [sn15.20:2.12](), [sn22.96:4.14]()). For its opposite _assāsa_ as “certainty” see [mn11:3.2]() and [mn93:6.7](). ",
  "mn76:8.14": "This is a nice example of how the “know and see” idiom corresponds to something like the English “what evidence do I have” ",
  "mn76:16.8": "This line is absent from the SN version of this passage. BB’s rendering no “killer, slaughterer, hearer, speaker, cognizer, intimator” is unclear if not incorrect. There are three terms, in plain and causative form. The sense of the first pair must be “kills and makes others kill”. As to the rest, the sense is clear from AN 8.16, where these are qualities of a teacher. I.e. these are ethical qualities, not merely cognitive faculties. ",
  "mn76:30.2": "I don’t find the commentarial explanation of amarā as “fish” to be plausible. The word appears nowhere else, and feels to me like a back-formation. To me it smells, well, fishy. DA 21 has 異問異答, “other question other answer”, where 異 evidently stands for añña or similar. In the other available translation on SC at T 21, I can’t determine the exact term, but in any case, it doesn’t seem to contain any reference to eels or fish. I can’t access the other parallels ATM. Using “eel-wriggling” is over-determining a dubious metaphor, and it is better to translate according to the sense. ",
  "mn76:43.1": "Bhikkhu here seems improbable. yet it is attested in the Mss, so I include it. BB omits. "
