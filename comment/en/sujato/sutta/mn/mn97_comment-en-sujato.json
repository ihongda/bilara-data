  "mn97:2.1": "The Southern Hills (_dakkhiṇāgiri_, “Deccan”) is the Vindhya Range that lies on the southern border of Magadha, leading southwest to Avanti. The Buddha and his disciples visited there rarely, so much so that people complained ([pli-tv-kd1:53.1.3]()). Nonetheless, the present narrative suggests that Sāriputta had stayed there for an extended period of time, long enough to lose touch with his friends back home. ",
  "mn97:2.8": "The “rice checkpoint” (_taṇḍulapālidvārā_) was a gate of Rājagaha where rice would be inspected and tolls collected. Here _pāli_ has the sense “guard” (cp. Sanskrit _pālin_). This was not Dhanañjāni’s residence, but where he worked and, it would seem, skimmed off funds for his own benefit. | Kauṭilya discusses corruption among government servants (Arthaśāstra 2.9), sets out the duties of the toll collector (2.21), and lists the various tolls (2.22). ",
  "mn97:2.14": "A faithful laywoman named Dhanañjānī features in [mn100]() and [sn7.1](), but this was a different person. The name appears to be a Pali variation of the Vedic _dhanañjaya_, “winner of wealth”. ",
  "mn97:5.4": "The five “proper offerings” correspond with the five to whom _bali_ offerings are made ([an4.61:15.2](), [an5.41:4.2]()). | In agreement with _brūhetabbo_ (“to be built up”), _pīṇetabbo_ is from _pīṇa_ in the sense “fatten” rather than “gladden”. ",
  "mn97:16.6": "",
  "mn97:30.12": "The “Gods of the Four Great Kings” are deities born in a realm subject to the overlords known as the Four Great Kings: Kuvera (also called Vessavaṇa) lord of spirits (_yakkha_) in the north; Dhataraṭṭha lord of centaurs (_gandhabba_) in the east; Virūḷha lord of goblins (_kumbhaṇḍa_) in the south; and Virūpakkha lord of dragons (_nāga_) in the west (see [dn32]()). ",
  "mn97:30.15": "The “Gods of the Thirty-Three”, who are subjects of Sakka (also called Indra), enjoy refined sensual delights. The number is a reduplication of the trinity. In Buddhist texts they are not enumerated, but Yājñavalkya reckons them as eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, plus Indra and Prajāpati (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.2). The final pair are elsewhere said to be Dyaus (“Heaven” = Zeus) and Pṛthivī (“Earth”), or the twin Aśvins. ",
  "mn97:38.7": "This is a rare instance of someone taking rebirth due to deathbed kamma. Presumably Dhanañjāni had developed absorption based on the divine meditations, which overpowered the limited bad kamma he had made previously ([mn99:24.3]()). Another instance of kamma at death influencing rebirth is found at [sn42.3:2.7](), where a warrior who dies in battle goes to hell. In Theravada circles today, it is commonly held that one’s mental state at death determines one’s rebirth. These examples show that this is true only in exceptional cases where one is actively making strong good or bad kamma at that time. "
