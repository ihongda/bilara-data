  "mn97:2.1": "The Southern Hills (_dakkhiṇāgiri_, “Deccan”) is the Vindhya Range that lies on the southern border of Magadha, leading southwest to Avanti. The Buddha and his disciples visited there rarely, so much so that people complained ([pli-tv-kd1:53.1.3]()). Nonetheless, the present narrative suggests that Sāriputta had stayed there for an extended period of time, long enough to lose touch with his friends back home. ",
  "mn97:2.8": "The “rice checkpoint” (_taṇḍulapālidvārā_) was a gate of Rājagaha where rice would be inspected and tolls collected. Here _pāli_ appears to have the sense “guard” (cp. Sanskrit _pālin_). This was not Dhanañjāni’s residence, but where he worked and, it would seem, skimmed off funds for his own benefit. | Kauṭilya discusses corruption among government servants (Arthaśāstra 2.9), sets out the duties of the toll collector (2.21), and lists the various tolls (2.22). ",
  "mn97:2.14": "A faithful laywoman named Dhanañjānī features in [mn100]() and [sn7.1](), but this was a different person. The name appears to be a Pali variation of the Vedic _dhanañjaya_, “winner of wealth”. ",
  "mn97:5.4": "The five “proper offerings” correspond with the five to whom _bali_ offerings are to be made ([an4.61:15.2](), [an5.41:4.2]()). | In agreement with _brūhetabbo_ (“to be built up”), _pīṇetabbo_ is from _pīṇa_ in the sense “fatten” rather than “gladden”. ",
  "mn97:16.6": "Reading anne for annesam as in PTS edition. otherwise it would be “others have livelihoods …” "
