  "mn47:1.1": "In this sutta, the Buddha shows his commitment to radical accountability and integrity. He does not merely pay lip service to the notion of open inquiry, but lays out a detailed and exacting procedure by which his students should test him. By extension, this approach may be applied to any spiritual teacher. ",
  "mn47:2.1": "The ability to comprehend the mind of another was considered an advanced meditative skill, not accessible even to all arahants. It allowed one to read the mind of another to the extent of one’s own realization. ",
  "mn47:4.2": "This refers to bodily behavior that might be seen or speech that might be heard. ",
  "mn47:7.3": "It is easy to maintain a front for while, but defilements tend to reveal themselves over time. ",
  "mn47:9.3": "Here _uparata_ means “stilled, ceased” rather than “restrained”. The commentary explains that one has become stilled (_uparata_) due to the absence of perils (_abhaya_). The test aims to distinguish the arahant from those for whom the perils of defilements and rebirth, though possibly suppressed for a time through the power of _jhāna_, are still present. ",
  "mn47:10.6": "BB and Horner follow comm in rendering sugata/duggata as “well behaved”. But it is not clear that it can have this sense, I cannot find any other source. Normally they mean “in a sorry state or good state”, “poor and prosperous”, eg SN 15.11, Thig 5.12, AN 5.200, DN 33. Now, out current sentence starts with “whether in a Sangha or alone”. So whoever this is talking about, it cannot refer to “practice” in the strict sense, as it must include local villagers. Of course it can still refer to general behavior. But I see no reason to depart from the normal sense. MA 186 just has a regular term for sugata here (善逝) so that is no help. ",
  "mn47:10.8": "https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-fearlessness-and-abstention/4062 ",
  "mn47:14.2": "Cp. AN 5.180 ",
  "mn47:16.1": "BB uses “reason” for akara in both its occurrences here. But imehi ākārehi imehi padehi imehi byañjanehi is a stock phrase, which in AN he renders “in this way, in these terms and phrases”. ",
  "mn47:16.2": "The two parallels for this passage, at SN 48.42, and DN 27, both lack ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, ākāravatī saddhā dassanamūlikā. Thus dalha is connected with asamhariya, contra MS text and BB’s translation, which makes better sense anyway. ",
  "mn47:16.4": "The phrasing of these last lines are odd, and no translation I have consulted accounts for the pana. I think the sense is that, while one should do an investigation as described in the sutta, the real test is the test of Dhamma, which the Buddha has already proven himself against. "
