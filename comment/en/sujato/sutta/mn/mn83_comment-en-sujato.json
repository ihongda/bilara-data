  "mn83:1.2": "Mithilā was the capital of Videha, to the north east of the Vajjian federation, nestled against the Himalayas. Mithilā was a dominant kingdom before the Buddha, its king Janaka featuring prominently in early Upaniṣads. But it is mentioned rarely in the suttas and had apparently declined in importance. It is unclear whether Mithilā had been subsumed into the Vajjian federation or remained as a minor independent kingdom until conquered by Magadha some years later. [dn19:36.7]() establishes the mythic origins of the land, and it is a setting for [mn91](), [thig6.2]() and [thig13.4](). ",
  "mn83:3.1": "In such contexts, dhamma approaches the later Hindu use of svadharma, i.e. the duty appropriate for ones’ station. Compare the rukkhadhamma at AN 6.54 ",
  "mn83:4.14": "BB has “take over the kingship” But cp DN 26, “imaṁ samuddapariyantaṁ pathaviṁ paṭipajja”, which shows rajjam must be the place here, i.e. realm. ",
  "mn83:4.18": "I am not comfortable with the syntax of this sentence, which appears to lack the expected pronouns. I wonder whether it could mean: “In whatever age of man is current that this good practice is broken, he is their last man.” But purisayuga elsewhere always means “pair of men”. ",
  "mn83:11.4": "For the record, this totals 28,224,000,000 years, which is the same order of magnitude of current estimates of the age of the Universe, at about 14,000,000,000. ",
  "mn83:12.1": "Nimi was one of the three main sons of Ikṣvāku (Okkāka), the legendary ancestor of the solar dynasty and the source of the Sakyan royal lineage (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 9.6.4). As the king of Videha, Nimi was the direct ancestor of Mahājanaka (Rāmāyaṇa 1.71.3). ",
  "mn83:13.13": "BB omits to translate kittayamanarupa. ",
  "mn83:15.15": "PTS has the expected upavassisāmi. ",
  "mn83:20.1": "The Janakas were the famed kingly house of Videha, here framed as the source of the kingdom’s decline. A King Janaka was Sītā’s father in the Rāmāyaṇa, and one discussed philosophy with Yājñavalkya in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. A Janaka is also featured in the Jātakas ([Ja 539](https://suttacentral.net/ja539)). It seems impossible to determine which, if any, are the same person. ",
  "mn83:21.14": "BB misses the plural here: the Buddha is addressing all the monks. "
