  "mn83:1.2": "Mithilā was the capital of Videha, to the north east of the Vajjian federation, nestled against the Himalayas. Mithilā was a dominant kingdom before the Buddha, its king Janaka featuring prominently in early Upaniṣads. It features rarely in the suttas ([mn91](), [thig6.2](), [thig13.4]()) and had apparently declined in importance. It is unclear whether Mithilā had been subsumed into the Vajjian federation or remained as a minor independent kingdom until conquered by Magadha some years later. [dn19:36.7]() establishes the mythic origins of the land from a Buddhist perspective, whereas Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.4.1.10–19 depicts its origins in terms of the spread of fire-worship from the west.

  "mn83:3.1": "For “stood by his duty” (_dhamme ṭhito_) compare “standing by the tree’s duty” (_rukkhadhamme ṭhito_) at [an6.54:12.4](). In such instances, _dhamma_ anticipates the later Hindu notion of _svadharma_, i.e. the duty appropriate for ones’ station. ",
  "mn83:4.6": "Such “messengers of the gods” appear as reminders for the dangers of mortality in [mn130]() and [an3.36](). In non-Buddhist texts they can also be celestial interlocutors in a more literal sense (eg. Mahābhārata 1.2.232b, 1.9.005d). ",
  "mn83:4.13": "The same point of view is expressed at [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21:1.4](), where sex workers teased nuns, suggesting they enjoy themselves while young and ordain when old. The Buddhist position is that Dhamma can be practiced at any age. ",

  "mn83:12.1": "Nimi was one of the three main sons of Ikṣvāku (Okkāka), the legendary ancestor of the solar dynasty and the source of the Sakyan royal lineage (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 9.6.4). As the king of Videha, Nimi was the direct ancestor of Mahājanaka (Rāmāyaṇa 1.71.3). ",

  "mn83:20.1": "The Janakas were the famed kingly house of Videha, here framed as the source of the kingdom’s decline. A King Janaka was Sītā’s father in the Rāmāyaṇa, and one discussed philosophy with Yājñavalkya in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. A Janaka is also featured in the Jātakas ([Ja 539](https://suttacentral.net/ja539)). It seems impossible to determine which, if any, are the same person. ",
