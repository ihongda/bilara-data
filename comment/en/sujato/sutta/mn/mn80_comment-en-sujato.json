  "mn80:2.1": "Vekhanasa, the “descendant of Vikhānasa” was, according to the commentary, the teacher of Sakaludāyī and came to defend his teaching. The Vekhanasas are known in later Sanskrit texts as an order of forest-dwelling ascetics, who apparently evolved into the modern Vaikhānasa Vishnavite tradition. He is thus named Vekhanasa after his tradition, but the Buddha calls him Kaccāna. ",
  "mn80:2.4": "The Rig Veda features two Vaikhānasa poems, one of which, by “a hundred Vaikhānasas”, describes Soma as “most resplendent” (_śubhraśastamaḥ_, Rig Veda 9.66.26), a phrase notably parallel to the Pali “ultimate splendor” (_paramo vaṇṇo_). These verses are rich with similar imagery: Soma is a “gleaming light” (24) whose “glittering drops” “flash with radiance” (25), “pervading with rays” (27), a “heaven-bright milk” (30). Perhaps the Vekhanasa lineage developed their philosophy from these verses, which they had recited over so many centuries that the original referent, Soma, was forgotten. ",
  "mn80:13.2": "Compare with the passage on extracting cream of ghee, which uses parallel syntax ([dn9:52.1](), [sn34.1:1.9](), [an4.95:4.1]()). ",
  "mn80:14.5": "I accept the repeated phrase here. It seems to me that Vekhanasa is not merely agreeing with the Buddha’s statement: if so, why is he rebuked? The repeated statement, to my mind, suggests that Vekhanasa wants to confirm that the Buddha’s postulate is true, which is why the Buddha questions his competence. "
