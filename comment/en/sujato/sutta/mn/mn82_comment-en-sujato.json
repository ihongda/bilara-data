  "mn82:1.1": "The story of Raṭṭhapāla, the “guardian of the nation”, has become one of the most famous and beloved parables from early Buddhism, a testament to a young man’s resolution and faith. But the power of Raṭṭhapāla’s determination to go forth should not overshadow the moving conversation he has with King Koravya at the end. ",
  "mn82:1.2": "Thullakoṭṭhika (“place of fat granaries”; Sanskrit _sthūlakoṣṭhaka_) only appears in the story of Raṭṭhapāla. ",
  "mn82:4.3": "From this point, the narrative is largely echoed in the story of Sudinna ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.7]()), with, however, a very different outcome. ",
  "mn82:6.6": "Elsewhere in the suttas the Buddha this stipulation is not mentioned, although he did require it also of Sudinna ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.1.14]()). As a Vinaya rule, this was instituted by the Buddha on the emotional request of his father, who was distraught when his grandson Rāhula went forth while still a boy ([pli-tv-kd1:54.4.2]()). It seems that it was originally meant to apply to novices who went forth as young as fifteen, or “when old enough to scare crows” ([pli-tv-kd1:51.1.14]()). This would explain its absence elsewhere in the suttas. Typically we find that over time the requirements for ordination become stricter, so that things required in a particular context are taken to apply to everyone. If this is so, the process must have happened quickly, so that even in the canonical full ordination procedure a candidate, who must be twenty years at least, must have permission of their parents ([pli-tv-kd1:76.1.12]()). However, this is not intended as an obstacle for ordination, as there are clearly many situations where it is impossible or untenable to get such permission. Thus if one does give the going-forth to someone without permission of the parents, it is a minor offence of wrong-doing for the mendicant performing the ordination, but it does not invalidate it ([pli-tv-kd1:54.6.5]()). ",
  "mn82:7.21": "A similar method was employed by Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesā, according to the commentary to [thig5.9](), to force her parents to allow her to marry the man she desired, who was, unfortunately, a convicted criminal. ",
  "mn82:17.1": "This is a sign of the dandified life expected of Raṭṭhapāla. Hairstyles for upper class men of the time were quite fancy, or at least they are depicted so in the early sculptures at Sanchi. ",
  "mn82:18.4": "This detail is remarkably similar to The Odyssey 19:361–475, where due to the marks on his feet, the maidservant Eurycleia recognizes Odysseus on his return even though his own wife did not. ",
  "mn82:19.3": "The same syntax recurs at [an5.166:11.2](), where it is clear the future tense expresses indignation rather than future time. ",
  "mn82:27.1": "The king of the Kurus. ",
  "mn82:35.1": "While these four summaries reflect key teachings of the Buddha, they are not found as such in early texts. ",
  "mn82:38.4": "",
  "mn82:38.5": "For _alamatto_ read _alamattho_, “capable”. ",
  "mn82:41.4": "",
  "mn82:41.23": "This is a rare acknowledgement of the existence of lands over the seas. ",
  "mn82:41.35": "This passage is a counterweight to the ideal of the Wheel-turning Monarch, who “after conquering this land girt by sea, reigns by principle, without rod or sword” (eg. [mn91:5.8]()). The Wheel-turning Monarch is in turn a Buddhist recasting of the Brahmanical notion of a king who rules by favor of the gods as demonstrated in the horse sacrifice. The idea of a righteous king whom all obey without coercion belongs rightly to legend, while as Raṭṭhapāla so eloquently, not to mention bravely, points out, the very desire to rule is founded on craving. ",
  "mn82:42.48": "_Virūparūpena_ appears at [dn24:1.17.8](), [ja522:18.3](), and [ja526:56.2](), where it always has the meaning “in disguise”. "
