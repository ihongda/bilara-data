  "mn86:2.1": "The reform of the serial killer Aṅgulimāla became one of the most popular stories in all Buddhism. His backstory was elaborated in the Pali commentaries and several parallels, with various overlaps and divergences. His deeds became inflated to an implausible degree, a tendency even here, for example in the claim that he laid waste to entire countries. ",
  "mn86:2.3": "The eponymous grotesquerie of a “finger garland” is explained by the commentary and various parallels as being a count of his victims killed by order of his former Brahmanical teacher, who assigned him this task out of jealousy. This implausible scenario was rejected by Richard Gombrich (*How Buddhism Began*, pg. 151), who proposed that Aṅgulimāla belonged to a violent cult. The shared core of canonical accounts, however, ascribe no religious motivation to his acts: he is just a killer. ",
  "mn86:3.9": "Saṁharitvā saṁharitvā is the obvious reading. But comm. says “Saṅkaritvā saṅkaritvāti saṅketaṁ katvā vaggavaggā hutvā” where sanketa evidently relies on sankaritva, but the term is read as implying “grouped”, i.e. samharitva. A sign of an old corruption? Also, note that the idiom is emphatic. ",
  "mn86:3.10": "Attha in hatthattha is attha2, as per comm: “Hatthatthaṁ gacchantīti hatthe atthaṁ vināsaṁ gacchanti”, a point overlooked by most translators. ",

  "mn86:9.4": "BB’s “attacking” seems a little excessive for kupita. ",
  "mn86:14.2": "Mulha here should be connected with the common sense of having “lost” the path, and hence unable to emerge. See Ud 2.8. The modern term is obstructed labor. ",
  "mn86:14.4": "_Garbakleśa_ in Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa 22.45 evidently has the sense, “travails of childbirth”. ",
  "mn86:15.2": "The asseveration of truth—the belief that “by this truth” (_tena saccena_, also at [snp2.14]()) effective results could be won—can be traced to Rig Veda 1.21.6 (_tena satyena_). ",
  "mn86:18.25": "pappuyya is absolutive, not optative as per BB. ",
  "mn86:18.26": "Creatures “firm and frail” (_tasathāvare_) is a common Jain idiom (eg. Uttarādhyayana 5.8: _tasesu thāvaresu ya_, Sūyagaḍa 3.4.20: _je keī tasathāvarā_, Dasaveyāliya 4.1.42: _tasaṃ vā thāvaraṃ vā_, Ācāraṅgasūtra 9.1.14_tasa-jīvā ya thāvarattāe_). "
