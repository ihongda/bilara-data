  "mn55:1.2": "Jīvaka was the Buddha’s doctor. His story is told in [pli-tv-kd8](), where we learn that he was the abandoned son of a courtesan. He was taken in by Prince Abhaya of Magadha, a Jain [mn58]() who was also interested in the teachings of  Pūraṇa Kassapa [sn46.56](). ",
  "mn55:3.2": "This was an accusation made against the Buddha by Jains ([an8.12:31.2](), [pli-tv-kd6:31.13.1]()). They objected only to eating meat “killed on purpose for him”, and so by implication not all eating of meat. This is consistent with several Jain scriptural passages indicating that ascetics may, under certain strictures, eat meat (Ācaraṅgasūtra 2.1.10.5–6, Bhagavatīsūtra 557 (p. 1261a), Kalpasūtra (Sāmācārī 17), Dasaveyāliyasutta 5–1.73). ",
  "mn55:5.2": "The relevant Vinaya rule makes the meaning clear: “When you know it was killed on purpose for you.” ([pli-tv-kd6:31.14.4]()). To allay suspicion of improper meat, mendicants are also required to check the provenance of meat before eating ([pli-tv-kd6:23.9.9]()). ",

  "mn55:7.6": "Greed, hate, and delusion are the fundamental underlying defilements that give rise to “ill will”, the opposite of love. "
