  "mn91:1.2": "This is, surprisingly, the only sutta that records the Buddha visiting Videha, although two other suttas report that he had been teaching there ([thig6.2:3.2](), [thig13.4:6.2]()). Videha was famous as the site of philosophical conversations in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, especially between Yājñavalkya and King Janaka. In my view, this sutta is constructed to show the Buddha’s conversion of a senior brahmin in Yājñavalkya’s tradition, possibly even a direct student. ",
  "mn91:2.1": "This brahmin seems to only be known from this sutta. | A few other people are said to have reached the advanced age of 120: Pasenadi’s grandmother ([sn3.22:2.1]()), some brahmins ([an3.51](), [an3.52]()), and most inspiringly, Dhammasavapitu who went forth at 120 ([thag1.108]()). ",

  "mn91:10.4": "This is apparently the only occurrence of adduva. Comm says “knees”, and the various dicts and translations follow this. But who walks knocking their knees? However, the Chinese text at T 76 clearly mentions knee: 行時踝膝不相切摩. The other parallel, at MA 161 does not seem to mention the knees: 行時兩踝終不相掁 ",
  "mn91:11.1": "“indoors” is incorrect. ",
  "mn91:12.2": "Note, again antaraghara does not mean indoors. Such contexts as these might be read in that way, as typically we think of sitting down indoors. However in the suttas we find cases of, for example Ratthapala, who sits down in an inhabited aread, but outside by a wall. In some places, eg northern Thailand, it is normal for monks to sit in a little open sala in or near the village where they receive offerings. ",
