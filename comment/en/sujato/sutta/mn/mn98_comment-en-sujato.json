  "mn98:2.2": "Also at [dn13:2.2]() and [mn99:13.5](). ",
  "mn98:3.1": "We meet Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja as the students of Pokkharasādi and Tārukkha respectively in [dn13](), at the end of which they went for refuge. Some time later they must have sought the monkhood, as in [dn27:1.3]() they are living in the Sangha awaiting ordination. ",
  "mn98:3.7": "_Vattasampanno_ (Sanskrit _vṛttasaṃpanna_) means “one of good conduct¸one who has fulfilled their duties” rather than having a technical sense of fulfilling religious observances or rites. For example, Manusmṛti 8.179 advises that one should deposit money with someone “who is of good conduct, who knows the law, and speaks the truth” (_vṛttasampanne dharmajñe satyavādini_. See also eg. Mahābhārata 3.188.90b, 13.61.029a, Rāmāyaṇa 1.47.25c). ",
  "mn98:7.23": "The Buddha as “eye” evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14, 5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the “eye of all” (_viśvacakṣāḥ_, 7.63.1), the “eye” for “eyes to see” (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14). See [dn16:5.6.3](). ",
  "mn98:8.27": "I think _yāna_ should be taken literally here as a chariot; consider the classic Indic imagery of flying chariots of the gods. ",
  "mn98:9.12": "sambadha means the “groin”, i.e. the cramped area including the genital region, anus, etc. Methuna here must be specifrically the sexual organs. ",
  "mn98:10.6": "_Sippa_ here is usually translated “craft”, but this refers primarily to occupations making things by hand. In DN 2 there is a long list of _sippa_, only a few of which are “crafts”. “Profession” fits better. ",
  "mn98:10.30": "Read _bhuñjati_ at [mn98:10.30]() with _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ at [dn17:1.9.4](), [dn26:6.7](), and [mn129:35.7](). Translators have rendered these with “eat”, “enjoy”, or “govern”. But compare the archaic English “use” meaning “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ means “use as has been used”, i.e. “maintain the current level of taxation”. "
