  "mn90:1.1": "The whole narrative of this sutta is entertainingly chaotic, with characters appearing and disappearing at random, many of whom are unknown or little-known elsewhere. It gives a lifelike impression of how hard it is to maintain a rational dialogue among the comings and goings. ",
  "mn90:1.2": "Ujuñña was a Kosalan town at which discussed asceticism with the the naked ascetic Kassapa in [dn8](). | “Deer parks” were nature reservations where the animals were safe from hunters. ",
  "mn90:3.1": "These sisters were apparently both married to the King and, like his chief queen Mallikā, were devoted to the Buddha. Somā is perhaps the devout laywoman mentioned at [an8.91-117:1.1](), but is probably not the bhikkhunī of the same name mentioned at [sn5.2](), [thig3.8](). Sakulā likewise is probably not the same person as the bhikkhunī mentioned in [thig5.7]() and [an1.242:1.1](). ",
  "mn90:5.3": "The Buddha was well aware of the fact that people did, in fact, make such claims, as he discussed them several times (eg. [mn76:21.1]()). He just thought the claims were wrong. One unique detail of the phrasing here is that it is in future tense (also used below at [mn90:8.5]()). The implication seems to be that not only is it the case that no-one currently makes such claims, but that no-one ever will in the future. | Compare with other statements on omniscience at [mn14:17.3]() and [mn71:5.2](). ",
  "mn90:6.1": "The King’s son and heir, whose disastrous reign heralded the destruction of the Sakyans and the collapse of the Kosalan empire. ",
  "mn90:6.3": "There is no brahmin clan of this name, so _ākāsa_ is likely a corruption of Sanskrit _āgastya_, the clan descending from the Vedic seer Agastya. ",
  "mn90:8.5": "Consciousness is conditioned, so any instance of knowing depends on a particular stimulus. At [mn76:52.5]() the Buddha discusses the related point of whether knowledge is continuous, illustrating it with a simile of an amputee. ",
  "mn90:9.8": "The Buddha acknowledges the social distinctions between the classes. ",
  "mn90:12.14": "_Nimmathita_ refers to the process whereby a flame is produced by “churning” with a fire-drill. See Rig Veda 3.23.1a, 3.29.12a, 6.48.5, 8.48.6a, etc. ",
  "mn90:13.2": "The sense of _atthi devā_ (“do gods survive?”) is made clear by the following discussion. Compare _atthi attā_ (“the self survives”) at [sn44.10:1.3]() and [mn2:8.2]() in the same sense. In such cases the verb _atthi_ implies continued existence in a future life. We find a similar usage in Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.20, where Naciketa wonders what happens to a man after he dies, as “some say he survives, while others say he does not survive” (_astīty eke nāyam astīti caike_). ",
  "mn90:13.6": "This builds on the discussion with Pasenadi in [mn88:10.6](), where “hurtful” or “afflicted” (_sabyābajjha_) behavior leads to suffering, elsewhere described as rebirth in a “hurtful” realm (eg. [mn57:8.2]()). ",
  "mn90:14.2": "In a few words we learn a lot about how Viḍūḍabha thinks: he is an afflicted god. ",
  "mn90:14.11": "Use of bho is unusual here, obviously he was not as devoted as his father. ",
  "mn90:14.19": "Is this the only use of bho with raja? ",
  "mn90:15.4": "BB has “venerable sir” as vocative here, which is incorrect. Pasenadi always uses bhante as vocative, and anyway, bho doesn’t mean venerable sir. In fact, in such idioms vata bho is just an exclamation, and is frequently not used as a vocative at all. "
