  "mn54:1.2": "Aṅga was the country to that controlled the Ganges to the east of both Magadha and Vesālī. The region of Aṅga north of both the Ganges and the Mahī was known as Aṅguttarāpa, “Aṅga North of the Water”. The market town of Āpaṇa was evidently the chief settlement of the region. ",

  "mn54:15.1": "This list of similes is also found at [mn22:3.8](), [an5.76:11.2](), and [thig16.1:41.1](), as well as in various parallels to these texts. There, the list is expanded from seven to ten (with minor variations in parallels), and it is quoted as a familiar teaching without any need for explanation. Several of the similes have an obscure interpretation; for example “fruit on a tree”, by itself, hardly evokes suffering. These considerations suggest that the list of similes, together with their explanations, first appeared here. ",
  "mn54:16.1": "In the similar passage at SN 19, we find kāka, crow, instead of kaṅka, heron. Given the behavior described here, I think it’s likely the original was, in fact, crow. The Chinese parallel at MN 203 does indeed have 烏, crow, here. Comm. is silent. ",
  "mn54:16.2": "The verbs here are uncertain, and readings vary considerably, both here and in the other occurence in SN 19. Here the comm. glosses clearly in the sense of “pecking and clawing” and I think it’s best to just stick to that. Compare Rig Veda 6.46.14, competing “like birds over raw flesh”. ",
