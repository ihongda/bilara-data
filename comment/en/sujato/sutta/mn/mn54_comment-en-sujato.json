  "mn54:3.1": "“Sarong” (_nivāsana_) is lay attire at [an3.39:1.4]() and monastic at [pli-tv-kd1:25.9.1](), while “cloak” (_pāvuraṇa_) is lay attire at [sn7.14:1.2]() and monastic at [pli-tv-bi-vb-np11]() and [pli-tv-bi-vb-np12](). These are evidently similar to the monastic _antaravāsaka_ and _saṅghāṭi_. | Parasols and sandals were considered inappropriate luxuries for monastics ([pli-tv-bi-vb-pc84](), [pli-tv-kd15:23.2.19](), [pli-tv-kd5:12.1.5]()), and it was considered disrespectful to teach someone thus attired ([pli-tv-bu-vb-sk57](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-sk62]()). There was, however, an exemption in all cases for health reasons, and monastics were allowed sandals outside of a village. ",
  "mn54:3.10": "Monastics were criticized as being “just like householders” for wearing sandals ([pli-tv-kd5:12.1.3]()) and sunshades ([pli-tv-kd15:23.2.8](), [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc8]()). ",

There, the list is expanded from seven to ten (with minor variations in parallels), and it is quoted as a familiar teaching without any need for explanation. Several of the similes have an obscure interpretation; for example “fruit on a tree”, by itself, hardly evokes suffering. These considerations suggest that the list of similes, together with their explanations, first appeared here. ",
  "mn54:16.1": "In the similar passage at SN 19, we find kāka, crow, instead of kaṅka, heron. Given the behavior described here, I think it’s likely the original was, in fact, crow. The Chinese parallel at MN 203 does indeed have 烏, crow, here. Comm. is silent. ",
  "mn54:16.2": "The verbs here are uncertain, and readings vary considerably, both here and in the other occurence in SN 19. Here the comm. glosses clearly in the sense of “pecking and clawing” and I think it’s best to just stick to that. Compare Rig Veda 6.46.14, competing “like birds over raw flesh”. ",
