  "mn56:1.2": "Pāvārika means “blanket-weaver”. Places were often named for their primary economic activity. Probably there was a community of blanket weavers and the park was owned by their leading merchant. ",
  "mn56:2.1": "Jain tradition holds that Mahāvīra passed at a Pāvā near Nāḷandā. Buddhist texts know only the Pāvā of the Mallians to the north. Evidently there has been some confusion, and perhaps “Pāvārika’s mango grove”, the site of discussions with Jains here and at [sn42.8](), is the Pāvā known to the Jains. Note, however, that the earliest Jain source for Mahāvīra’s passing, the Kalpasutra, does not say where Pāvā is. But it does say the events were commemorated by the rulers of Kāsī and Kosala, and the Mallians and the Licchavīs. The absence of Magadha and the presence of Malla sit better with the location of Pāvā in Malla rather than Magadha. ",
  "mn56:2.2": "In Sanskrit, Dīrghatapasvin was a common name, or rather epithet, for ascetics, meaning “long fervor” in honor of lengthy dedication to practices such as starvation. It is presumably the Dīgha Tapassī of this sutta who is inscribed in a Buddhist stupa at Bharhut teaching a group of students. At least one of the students appears to be holding a small stick, which may be a pictorial representation of the subject of this discourse. ",
  "mn56:3.5": "This usage is found in such Jain texts as Uttarādhyayanasūtra 8.10. It was evidently common enough that it could be referred to obliquely as the “three rods” (20.60; see too Isibhāsiyāiṁ 25.2, 35.0.6). ",
  "mn56:3.12": "I have not been able to identify a statement to this effect in the Jain texts. All three “rods” create _karma_, which in Jainism is a kind of subtle matter (_pudgala_) that adheres to and obscures the soul ( Tattvārthasūtra 6.1–2). The emphasis in Jain texts is not to argue that any of the three rods is worst, but that one must never cause any harm through any of the three. ",
  "mn56:5.1": "Bālaki is obscure. The commentary says it could mean either “foolish” (which seems unduly harsh) or “from the village of the child salt miners” (which is obscure and distant, [mn128:7.1]()). A Dṛpta Bālāki of the Gārgya clan features in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.1, so perhaps it was a proper name. ",
  "mn56:7.3": "",
  "mn56:8.4": "This is a setup intended to satirize Mahāvīra’s claims to omniscience. ",
  "mn56:9.14": "Upāli made sure to hear the Buddha’s side before proceeding. ",
  "mn56:11.2": "Jain ascetics could not use cold water on account of the living creatures therein. Ācāraṅgasūtra 2.2.1.8 says a _nigaṇṭha_ must not stay at a lay person’s house because they may fall ill and be treated with, among other things, cold water.  Uttarādhyayanasūtra 1.1.3.7 dismisses the Buddhist claim that mere filtering is sufficient to render water allowable. ",
  "mn56:12.1": "",
  "mn56:12.2": "MS has _nigaṇṭho nāṭaputto_, but I follow PTS _nigaṇṭho_, in line with the pattern in this sutta and with the parallel at [dn2:29.4](). | At Isibhāsiyāiṁ 29.19, Vardhamāna ( Mahāvīra) teaches that a sage is _savva-vārīhiṃ vārie_, “restrained in all restraints”, which clearly parallels our current passage. In that passage, “restraint” refers to stopping the influx of defilements through the five senses, neither delighting in the pleasant nor loathing the unpleasant. | _Dhuta_ in the sense “shaken off (evil by means of ascetic practices)” is a characteristic Jain term. | For _sabbavāriphuṭo_ compare _ophuṭo_ at [mn99:15.5](). In both cases _phuṭ_ appears in a string of terms from the root _var_, and is possibly a corrupted form, or at least has the same meaning. ",
  "mn56:15.1": "As in DN 23. ",
  "mn56:19.7": "This is even harsher than it appears, for one of the Jains’ rules is not to wait when invited for food. See MN 45, etc. ",
  "mn56:20.12": "BB phrases as a question, but just below the same phrase is used by Mahavira, where it is clearly not a question. ",
  "mn56:23.5": "The gatekeeper is the real hero here. ",
  "mn56:24.2": "I take pariggahetva as referring to Upali gently embracing Mahavira, a sign of their closeness. The word is used in only one other passage, where it refers to a nurse cradling a baby’s head. AN 5.7, MN 57. ",
  "mn56:25.4": "I’m not sure why BB reads “removing” for haraka. Why use ubbhata and haraka if they mean the same thing? I cannot find any references that justify PTS dict’s reading “removal” for this, i guess it is based on this passage, but elsewhere it seems to mean “carrier, deliverer” so far as i can see. But the real problem is that it ruins the metaphor. Mahavira didn’t want to blind Gotama: he thought he was already blind. He wanted to make him see properly, i.e. in line with Jainism. This simile is discussed at length in Analayo, Comparative Studies, but I do not find his arguments persuasive, as they end up making unclear metaphors. ",
  "mn56:27.1": "I avoid using “girl” here as it perhaps implies the practice of child marriage, for which I don’t know any evidence at such a time. The typical age for a girl’s readiness for marriage was 16, so we should assume she was somewhat older than this. ",
  "mn56:27.3": "Though the word is not used, this is the dohala. ",
  "mn56:27.20": "BB’s rendering “will give delight to fools” follows the comm., but I think it misses the point of the simile. When you dye a cloth with natural dye, it will initially look fine. But the cloth must be continually pounded for the dye to settle in, otherwise it washes out quickly. That’s the point of the simile with the monkey, you can dye it, but the color will soon wash out because it can’t be fixed properly. So it will only pass a trivial inspection. I can’t make the simile work literally, so I give an interpretative translation. ",
  "mn56:28.1": "sarajika parisa is translated thus by BB at SN 7.2 ",
  "mn56:29.7": "Reading Vessantara, as in the famous Jataka. MA 133 here has 安隱, where 隱 represents antara, and 安 may be sama. Vessa in the sense of “all” is almost unknown in Pali, and I think the unfimiliarity has led to the various readings and interpretations. the commentarial reading, which BB follows requires reading vesaman-tara, which I don’t find persuasive. ",
  "mn56:29.35": "The series of terms here is all brahmanical, so we should take padaka in the usual sense as in eg. AN 3.58. ",
  "mn56:29.37": "Again, since the verse is pretty much entirely pre-Buddhist/vedic, surely we should read in that way here. Purindada is “crusher of strongholds”, reinterpreted in SN 11.12 as “giver in stronghold” or perhaps “first of givers”. But I think the primary sense is really just “destroyer”, “almighty”, etc. And as sakka is routinely called the lord of gods, surely this is the sense here, rather than “capable”. ",
  "mn56:29.42": "This is about samadhi, see SN 1.38, AN 3.97 ",
  "mn56:29.45": "Read _samaggatassa_. ",
  "mn56:29.46": "See Ud 4.1, also in the context of meditation, where this is evidently the sense. ",
  "mn56:29.47": "reading appabhitassa ",
  "mn56:29.59": "The Chinese here evidently reads akkha, but especially in the context of ahuneyya I think yakkha fits better, as offerings to yakkhas are a major theme. ",
  "mn56:30.1": "The whole passage pivots on the ambiguity between vanna as “colour, beautiful feature” (cf. anekavanna= many colors in Kd 1), which clearly underlies the simile (cf. also the similes of flowers held together by thread at Pj 1), and vanna as “praise”. The Kadā saṁyūḷhā pana te idiom is used at DN 21 of gatha. I try to bring out these connections. "
