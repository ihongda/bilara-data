At [mn21:7.4]() the Buddha reminisced about the days when he merely needed to mention it and monks would follow suit. | In the related story at [mn70](), the Buddha encouraged not eating at night, to which monks also objected, occasioning the laying down of a Vinaya rule ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37]()).

  "mn65:3.3": "The commentary says that he feared he would not be able to sustain his monkhood. Chinese parallels at this point indicate that he feared discomfort (EA 49.7 at T ii 800b29, T 1425 at T xxii 359b14). ",
  "mn65:4.2": "_Ekāsano_ here in Mahāsaṅgīti edition appears superfluous, as it is missing in most editions. ",
  "mn65:4.6": "“Would not see the Buddha face to face” is a loose rendering of _na bhagavato sammukhībhāvaṁ adāsi_. The idiom can be captured more literally at [dn3:2.6.2](); when King Pasenadi meets Pokkharasādi, he does not “grant him an audience face to face” (_tassa … sammukhībhāvampi na dadāti_) but only behind a curtain.
