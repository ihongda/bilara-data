  "mn68:2.2": "Pali editions vary a little in the exact monks mentioned. ",
  "mn68:4.2": "Reading _te va_ as in PTS. Here the Buddha switches from addressing the monks as a whole to addressing just Anuruddha and his friends. ",
  "mn68:5.4": "The terms here follow the same sequence as in the Vinaya account of ordination. | Soldiers joined the Sangha to escape military service, so the Buddha said one should not ordain those in service to a king ([pli-tv-kd1:40.1.1]()). | Several rules regarding ordination of criminals were passed, the general tenor of which is that wanted outlaws should not be ordained ([pli-tv-kd1:41.1.1]()). | Another man ordained to escape debt ([pli-tv-kd1:46.1.1]()). | Seventeen boys ordained as novices to get a nice livelihood ([pli-tv-kd1:49.1.1]()). | The only item that does not straightforwardly correspond is “under threat” (_bhayaṭṭa_) which appears in the sequence where the ordination of slaves is discussed ([pli-tv-kd1:47.1.1]()). The connection is suggested by the verses of the water-carrier Puṇṇikā, who speaks of her life “under threat” of her masters’ abuse and beatings. "
