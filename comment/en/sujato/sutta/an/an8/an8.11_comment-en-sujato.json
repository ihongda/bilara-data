  "an8.11:1.3": "BB and Brahmali have “brahmin of Veranja” (cf. [mn42]()). But the normal connective form is Veranjaka. (MN 42). He would have been a brahmin known after his town, a common convention even today. ",
  "an8.11:4.1": "BB translates the commentary with his “convivial”. Horner, followed by Brahmali, have “enjoyment”. But nibbhoga is always used in the sense of “useless, abandoned”. SN 7.14 “Assova jiṇṇo nibbhogo,” Pv 12, Ja 354 “Evaṁ sarīre nibbhoge, pete kālaṅkate sati”. Here it probably means “has no use for polite standards”, thus similar to the previous. We can maintain the pun by using indelicate here and delight below. ",
  "an8.11:5.4": "This is parallel to AN 2.32 ",
  "an8.11:10.1": "_Apagabbha_ is Sanskrit _apagalbha_, “not bold, immature”. The Buddha twists the sense to pun on _apa_ + _gabbha_ (“away from the womb”). "
