  "an10.107:1.1": "Manuscripts just have “washing”, but this sutta is quoted in the commentary to [dn1:1.13.2](), where the quotation has “bone-washing”. It is explained as a ritual where the dead are buried until fully decayed, then exhumed. They wash them, arrange them, and honor them with scents and flowers. At an astrological conjunction they first weep and wail then celebrate. Similar “second funerals” are found among many peoples of the world as a way of both terminating the death process and honoring ancestors. "
