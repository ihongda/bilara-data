  "an2.60:1.1": "The _kiṁpurisa_ (literally, “what man?”) appears in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.2.3.9 and 7.5.2.32 as a substitute in the human sacrifice. The sense is obscure, but clearly it refers to a physical entity of some kind, rather than a mystical creature. It is speculated to be (1) a facsimile of a human created for the sacrifice, (2) a human-like animal such as a monkey, or (3) a kind of human considered to be degraded and uncivilized. The context here, however, revolves around the use of speech. Since neither a facsimile nor a monkey requires an explanation why they do not speak, the more plausible explanation is the third. Thus a _kiṁpurisa_ may be a tribal person or aborigine whose speech was incomprehensible, and was hence regarded as not using human speech. ",
  "an2.63:1.1": "Var readings vacisamhara, vacisamsara, vacisankhara: MN 103 Comm: Vacīsaṁhāroti vacanasañcāro. Imehi kathitaṁ amūsaṁ antaraṁ paveseyya, tumhe imehi idañcidañca vuttāti amūhi kathitaṁ imesaṁ antaraṁ paveseyyāti attho, Tika: Vacanasañcāroti pesuññavasena aññathāvacanupasaṁhāro. The parallel passage is at AN 2.63, where samsara is the MS reading, and adopted by BB there. Comm there gives a completely different explanation: ubhato vacīsaṁsāroti dvīsupi pakkhesu aññamaññaṁ akkosanapaccakkosanavasena saṁsaramānā vācā vacīsaṁsāro. Tika has: Saṁsaramānāti pavattamānā. Despite this, I think the reading samhara makes better sense, as per MN comm. "
