  "an6.57:1.3": "“Classes” alone does not capture the sense of abhijati, i.e. rebirth into a class. ",
  "an6.57:3.1": "These _bhikkhus_ may well have been Buddhist mendicants. The reference to _kaṇṭakavuttikā_ is unclear. Compare _kasiravuttike_  in the sense “those whose life is tough” (eg. [an6.57:11.2]()), which suggests the sense, “those whose life is thorny”. Alternatively, Basham (*History and Doctrine of the Ājīvikas*, page 139) renders _kaṇṭaka_ as “thieves”, evidently following Manu 9.256–260, which describes various “thorns” (i.e. “pests”) as thieves, etc. Perhaps it means “those who are thorns in our sides”.
