  "an3.113:1.5": "In his note on this passage, Bhikkhu Bodhi shows that the commentary connects _pātabyata_ in this idiom to _pivati_ (“drink”). However, in the parallel to [dn27:17.3]() in the [Mūlasarvāstivāda Saṁghabhedavastu](https://suttacentral.net/san-mu-kd17/san/gbm), we find _pātakavratam_, which must derive from _pāta_ (“fall”). "
